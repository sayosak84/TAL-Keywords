 introduction.
about 25 years ago the density-matrix renormalization group (dmrg) emerged as a precision tool for the numerical description of one-dimensional quantum many-body systems [ 1 ].
starting with [ 2 ] it was applied successfully to many spin and strongly interacting electron systems.
later it was realized that dmrg can be reformulated in terms of matrix product states (mpss) [ 3 , 4 ].
a comprehensive review of mps algorithms and their relation to dmrg is presented in [ 5 ].
in this review most algorithms are formulated without regard to symmetries such as u(1) or su(2).
however, already östlund and rommer [ 3 , 4 ] in an attempt to understand the success of dmrg used su(2) symmetric mps.
they realized that the local matrices (tensors) decompose into a structural part given by the symmetry and a degeneracy part.
the structural part consists of a clebsch-gordan coefficient, and the (variational) parameters of the model reside in the degeneracy part only.
the number of parameters to be determined is therefore significantly reduced with respect to a non-symmetric theory.
this approach, first suggested by östlund and rommer, was then generalized to higher order tensors in [ 6 ] and then applied to mera tensor network calculations [ 7 - 9 ].
general relations between the symmetry of two-body hamiltonians and the local symmetry structure of translational invariant mps and peps (projected entangled pair states) are studied in [ 10 , 11 ].
tensor networks with su(3) and more general non-abelian symmetry were investigated in [ 12 ].
in addition to the basic implementation of symmetry into a tensor network with the purpose of reducing the number of independent parameters, it is possible to entirely eliminate the structural tensors and develop algorithms in terms of the degeneracy tensors only [ 13 - 16 ].
this reduces the requirements for computational resources significantly, and in turn enables significant improvements to the accuracy of the results that can be obtained.
the elimination of structural tensors from the algorithms requires changes to standard (non-symmetric) tensor network implementations, e.g. via precomputation schemes as suggested in [ 9 ].
it is the purpose of the present paper to develop an algorithm for su(2) symmetric mps with periodic boundary conditions (pbcs) in terms of reduced tensors only.
we express symmetric tensors (using the wigner-eckart theorem) in terms of reduced tensors (degeneracy tensors) and structural tensors consisting of products of clebsch-gordan coefficients.
to this end we strictly follow the methods and conventions of edmonds [ 17 ].
we do not use the tree decompositions advocated in [ 9 ] for the representation of symmetric tensors.
the linear maps relating different tree decompositions of symmetric tensors derived in [ 9 ] directly correspond to expressions relating different coupling schemes [ 17 ] in terms of racah \(  \)6j , wigner \(  \)9j , or more general symbols.
consequently, the precomputations for the linear maps suggested in [ 9 ] may be expressed in terms of such symbols.
furthermore, we apply the proposed algorithm to a physically rather complex one-dimensional model: the spin-1 bilinear-biquadratic heisenberg (bbh) model on a ring,   with \(  \)n+1 set to 1 and \(  \)sand#x020d7;i the spin- s su(2) matrix representations.
in doing so we will reproduce a number of well-known results, e.g. a precise calculation of the haldane gap in order to check the capabilities of the proposed algorithm.
moreover, we will study the spectrum of the bbh hamiltonian for pbc and various θ , which have not yet been addressed in the literature.
this will shed some light on old questions concerning the phase structure to be discussed below.
the bbh model describes the behavior of atomic spinor condensates in optical lattices [ 18 - 22 ] under certain conditions.
it also models the physics of some quasi-one-dimensional crystals, e.g., in livge o [ 23 ] or ni(c h n ) no clo (nenp) [ 24 ].
furthermore, it was extensively used as a test bed for new tensor network algorithms [ 25 - 27 ].
however, these algorithms do not explicitly implement su(2) symmetry, and the methods developed here (and for infinite systems in [ 28 ]) could serve well to implement su(2) symmetry into those approaches.
the continuous su(2) symmetry of the bbh model cannot be broken due to the mermin-wagner-coleman theorem [ 29 , 30 ].
as a consequence the eigenstates of this hamiltonian can be characterized by the total angular momentum quantum number j .
due to the (discrete) translational symmetry, the eigenstates can also be labeled by the quasi-momentum quantum number p .
however, unlike su(2) symmetry, translational symmetry will not be built into our mps ansatz explicitly in the present paper.
the bbh model has other symmetries not explicitly built into the mps here, e.g. su(3) symmetry at \(  \)θ=±12π, \(  \)θ=14π and \(  \)θ=-34π , a symmetry not easily uncovered in the spin representation of the model [ 31 ].
as a function of the control parameter θ the infinite-size spin-1 bbh model exhibits the rich phase structure shown in figure 1 [ 32 ].
we briefly discuss the various phases moving around the circle of the phase diagram in a clockwise direction.
for \(  \)π4≫θ≫-π4 the system is in the gapped haldane phase with hidden topological order [ 33 , 34 ].
the ground_state has spin j = 0 and is non-degenerate.
the first excited_state is a triplet (spin-1).
at \(  \)θ=0 the model corresponds to the simple heisenberg antiferromagnet and at \(  \)θ=arctan13 the ground_state is the aklt state [ 35 ].
at \(  \)θ=-π4 the gap vanishes and there is a second order phase transition to the dimerized phase [ 36 , 37 ].
the dimerized phase extends from \(  \)θ=-π4 to \(  \)θ=-3π4 .
the ground_state is a doubly degenerate j = 0 state with a gap to either spin-1 or spin-2 excited_state [ 38 ].
it shows non-zero dimer order [ 39 , 40 ].
at \(  \)θ=-π2 the (biquadratic) model can be mapped to the spin-1/2 xxz model and, therefore, it is exactly solvable using the bethe ansatz [ 40 , 41 ].
this point is characterized by very long-ranged spin correlations [ 41 ] and 'maximum' nearest-neighbor entanglement.
according to [ 42 , 43 ], the dimer order parameter behaves non-typically in the parameter region \(  \)θc≈-0.67π≫θ≫-3π4 , and quadrupolar spin correlations increase dramatically there.
the conjecture of chubukov [ 44 ] that there is a gapped nematic phase in this parameter region was debated in [ 19 , 45 ] and rejected in [ 46 ].
based on the proposal of [ 46 ], the dimerization close to \(  \)θ=-3/4π was determined explicitly in [ 47 ].
numerically, the existence of the nematic gapless phase in the narrow vicinity of \(  \)θ=-3π/4 is not yet ruled out, since the values to be calculated are comparable with the precision of the numerical calculations in that parameter region [ 43 , 48 ].
in the region \(  \)5π4≫θ≫π2 the system is in a gapless ferromagnetic phase with a multi-fold degenerate ground_state.
at the critical point \(  \)θ=-3π4 the system exhibits su(3) symmetry [ 31 ].
the ferromagnetic phase is followed by a gapless phase with dominating quadrupolar spin correlations [ 43 , 49 ] for \(  \)π2≫θ≫π4 .
at the lai-sutherland point \(  \)θ=π4 the system undergoes a kosterlitz-thouless phase transition [ 39 , 50 ] into the haldane phase.
at the lai-sutherland critical point the system shows su(3) symmetry and is exactly solvable by the bethe ansatz (see, e.g., [ 38 , 51 ]).
using the proposed su(2) symmetric mps algorithm for pbc, we calculate energy spectra and characteristic correlation functions in different phases of a spin ring at selected parameter values θ .
the calculated energy gaps between these states enable already an elucidation of the phase structure from finite system results.
in particular, the existence of a fifth (nematic) phase can be addressed.
for the haldane phase we calculate the string correlator of the ground_state and in the dimerized phase the dimerization from the lowest two j = 0 states.
these two states form a degenerate doublet in the thermodynamic limit .
the paper is organized as follows.
in section 2 we briefly review the mps formalism for pbcs which is based on the algorithm proposed by verstraete et al [ 52 ].
in section 3 this algorithm is rewritten using su(2) symmetric tensors only.
as already emphasized, it is an objective of the present paper to eliminate all structural tensors from the pbc algorithm.
this is more complicated than for obc since higher order tensors must be considered.
these technical developments are relegated to several appendices, which form an important part of the present article and should enable a straightforward implementation of the algorithm.
as a consequence we only need to handle the degeneracy parts of the tensors explicitly.
this enables significant improvements to the efficiency of the implementation.
in fact, the mps virtual dimensions we are able to use are much larger than in various recently proposed implementations for pbc without su(2) symmetry, e.g. [ 25 , 26 ].
we provide the reduced mpo representation for the bilinear-biquadratic spin- s hamiltonian as well as the corresponding reduced representation for h <sup>2</sup> and other operators.
this enables the calculation of the variance \(  \)⟨h2⟩-⟨h⟩2 of the various eigen-energies.
we apply the proposed su(2) symmetric algorithm to the bilinear-biquadratic spin-1 heisenberg model in section 4 and discuss the low lying spectrum in all phases except the ferromagnetic phase.
we also briefly address in appendix f the spin-1/2 heisenberg model and compare our numerical results with bethe ansatz calculations.
the results of our work are summarized in section 5 .
 review: the mps formalism for pbc.
an mps formalism for pbc was originally proposed in [ 52 ] and extended in [ 21 , 53 ].
we summarized the algorithm in [ 54 , 55 ], and therefore we only briefly review here those aspects which are relevant for the present discussion.
the state of a 1d quantum many body system of size n is approximated in terms of a matrix product state   here, the \(  \)σi represent the local degrees of freedom at site \(  \)[i] .
the local hilbert space is assumed to be finite dimensional, and its basis is enumerated by the \(  \){σi} .
the elements \(  \)mai-1,ai[i],σi of the rank-3 tensors \(  \)m[i] are the parameters characterizing a particular state.
for periodic systems we set \(  \)a0=an , and the dimension of the bond indices a is set to m .
analogously, operators are written as matrix product operators   each \(  \)w[i] is a rank-4 tensor: \(  \)wii-1,ii[i],σi,σi' with \(  \)i0=in .
the bond indices i of operators have dimension m , and the operators studied in the present work can be expressed exactly in terms of w tensors with small bond dimension.
matrix elements of mpo in mps,   can be expressed in terms of the rank-6 (generalized) transfer tensor \(  \)ew[i] with the tensor elements   the matrices a and b characterize the states \(  \)|φ⟩ and \(  \)|ψ⟩ , respectively.
the special transfer tensor \(  \)e1[i](a,b) represents the matrix element \(  \)⟨φ|ψ⟩ of the identity operator (with \(  \)i¯=i=1 ).
note, that we chose to write the algorithm in terms of higher-rank tensors in order to ease the implementation of su(2) symmetry in the next section.
parentheses are used to group indices conveniently.
in order no minimize the energy variationally, due to pbc one has to solve at each update step the generalized eigenvalue problem   written in terms of the effective hamiltonian matrix \(  \)heff and the effective normalization matrix \(  \)neff .
the elements of these matrices are obtained from     the 'blocks' \(  \)hl[i],nl[i] and \(  \)hr[i],nr[i] are contractions of the transfer tensors e and e (as defined in equation ( 5 )) to the left or to the right of the site i , respectively.
(in order to define what is left and right we initially label the sites from 1 to n , and keep this labeling throughout the calculation.
all sites with label smaller than i are left of site i and all sites with label larger than i are right of site i .)
a contraction of a block with a transfer tensor is depicted in figure 2 .
the block and transfer tensors are kept rank-6 throughout the algorithm.
we assume summation over repeated indices, however, for clarity we sometimes write out the summations explicitly.
brackets are used in order to indicate fusion of several indices into a combined single index.
the update is performed in the standard dmrg 'sweeping' manner as proposed in [ 52 ].
the value \(  \)ε[i] eventually converges to the ground_state energy during the iterative update procedure.
the updated mps is obtained by a suitable partitioning of the vector into a tensor:   after each update step the local mps tensor is regauged in order to keep the algorithm stable, i.e. we modify each local mps tensor \(  \)m[i] such that one of the following relations is fulfilled,    
the algorithm presented above not only allows the variational determination of ground_states but also the calculation of excited_states.
they can be constructed by finding the lowest state in the (sub)space orthogonal to the space spanned by the states already found [ 21 ].
in order to implement a corresponding update procedure for an mps in this subspace we need to solve the generalized eigenvalue problem   where \(  \)p[i] projects the effective hamiltonian ( 7 ) and the effective normalization matrix ( 8 ) into the relevant subspace.
i.e., the local mps tensor must not only minimize the effective hamiltonian, but must also be constructed in such a way that the mps \(  \)|ψ⟩ of a 'new' excited_state to be calculated is orthogonal to all mps \(  \)|φk⟩ already calculated before: \(  \)⟨ψ|φk⟩=0 for all k .
here, k enumerates these states: k = 0 for the ground_state, k = 1 for the first excited_state, etc.
we denote the tensors of the states \(  \)|φk⟩ by \(  \)φk[i] and the tensors of the 'new' excited_state by \(  \)m[i] .
then the local projection operator \(  \)p[i] must fulfill the condition \(  \)p[i]y[i]†=0 with y a matrix of k row vectors   obtained from the condition \(  \)⟨ψ|φk⟩=0 for all k .
the projection matrix \(  \)p[i] is determined by an orthogonalization of the matrix \(  \)y[i] .
the rank-6 'block' tensors \(  \)ol,k[i] and \(  \)or,k[i] are the contractions of all transfer tensors \(  \)e1(m,φk) to the left or right of site i , respectively.
(again, summation over repeated indices is assumed in equation ( 13 ).)
 su(2)-symmetric mps algorithm for pbc.
we now introduce su(2) symmetry into the formalism presented above: we assume an su(2) symmetric hamiltonian and su(2) symmetric states, i.e. the symmetry is not broken.
this holds in 1d due to the mermin-wagner-coleman theorem.
technically, all tensor indices can then be chosen to be su(2) invariants, i.e. they decompose into a total spin (angular momentum) index s , a spin projection index m as well as a degeneracy index t , which counts the number of times a specific su(2) representation occurs, e.g. \(  \)σ=(s,t,ms) .
for the physical indices of mps we have t = 1, however the spins in the bond indices are highly degenerate.
in practice, we only need moderate degeneracies \(  \)t≪10 for our calculations.
first we briefly introduce su(2) symmetric mps and discuss the construction of states with given total angular momentum j .
we eliminate all structural tensors from the algorithm in section 3.2 as well as several appendices.
 construction of su(2)-symmetric mpss for pbc.
first we discuss how to construct su(2) invariant states, i.e. states with total spin j = 0.
the set of mps matrices defined in equation ( 2 ) must be brought into an su(2) symmetric form at every site i .
the structure of the rank-3 local tensor \(  \)m[i] at position i is determined by the wigner-eckart theorem [ 9 ] according to which the tensor decomposes into a degeneracy part \(  \)and#x0e239; and a structural part c   with the structural part fixed by su(2) symmetry and given in terms of the wigner \(  \)3j symbol 3   the degeneracy part (also often called 'reduced tensor') is denoted by a script letter while the corresponding full tensor is denoted by a roman letter.
here, for simplicity, we omit the position index i (this index will be reintroduced whenever necessary).
it is often convenient to use a combined index \(  \)γ=(j,t) , i.e. \(  \)and#x0e239;(jt),(j't')=and#x0e239;γ,γ' .
the degeneracy part \(  \)and#x0e239; does not depend on the spin projections and contains the (variational) parameters of the state.
note that the reduced matrix elements of the mps for which the spins \(  \)j,s,j' do not fulfill the 'triangle rule'   can be set to zero, as the corresponding \(  \)3j symbol vanishes under these conditions.
this makes the reduced mps matrices rather sparse, in fact, they have a banded block structure.
we will call the set of all \(  \)(jt) which characterize a reduced matrix its degeneracy set d , e.g. \(  \)d={(1/2,2),(3/2,4),(5/2,3)} .
in practice, we want to choose the smallest possible set with few different spins j and small degeneracies t .
however, it must be noted that at present we have no method in order to choose this set algorithmically.
of course, for a large system we expect that the required degeneracies will be large.
on the other hand the size of the degeneracy sets is strictly limited by the available computing resources.
we will discuss this issue further in the following sections.
we now turn to the construction of covariant states with total spin \(  \)j≠0 .
to achieve this a fictitious non-interacting (local) spin \(  \)j≫0 [ 8 , 14 ] is inserted into the system.
the fictitious spin is inserted at the site \(  \)n+1 , i.e. between site n and site 1.
the tensor at this additional site takes the form   and the resulting mps has total spin 0.
for completeness, we define \(  \)f0,0=1 .
after optimization of the tensor network with the fictitious spin one needs to obtain the covariant state \(  \)|jm⟩ , which is given by   this state must be normalized if required.
in practice, we seldom need to reconstruct the state using equation ( 17 ), since the calculation of su(2) invariant observables can be expressed in terms of the reduced tensors only as is shown further down in this section.
 the optimization algorithm for su(2) symmetric mps for pbc.
in order to make best use of the symmetry, it is advantageous to introduce a reduced tensor structure not only for the mps but for all other tensors of the algorithm as well.
this enables to express the whole algorithm in terms of degeneracy tensors only, and spin projection indices and the structural parts of the mps will be completely eliminated from the algorithm.
as a consequence, the computations are significantly more efficient, and calculations with much larger virtual dimensions become feasible.
in the present section we will explain how the pbc algorithm presented in section 2 is rewritten in terms of reduced tensors only.
technical details will be relegated to several appendices.
the results contained in these appendices will enable a rather straightforward implementation of the proposed algorithm.
for open boundary conditions a similar strategy was followed by mcculloch [ 16 ] but not described in much detail.
however, for pbc we face a number of differences, in particular, the 'block' tensors, i.e., the products of transfer tensors, are rank-6 tensors for pbc, while they are rank-3 in the obc implementation.
in the following, we will provide the general definition of reduced tensors and exemplify the construction of reduced tensors for rank-4 w tensors, which are the building blocks of mpo.
we then go on to describe the variational algorithm for the determination of mps in terms of reduced tensors.
in order to introduce rank- k su(2) invariant tensors \(  \)ta1,…,ak each index has to be decomposed into a spin index, a degeneracy index, and a spin projection index, e.g. \(  \)a1=(j1,t1,mj1) in the same way we did for the tensor indices of mps tensors in equation ( 14 ).
for \(  \)k≥3 an element of a su(2)-invariant rank- k tensor may be obtained from the generalized wigner-eckart theorem [ 6 , 9 , 17 ]   where \(  \)e1,…,ek-3 are intermediate indices to be summed over, \(  \)(and#x0e240;je1,⋯,jek-3)γa1,γa2,⋯,γak is a reduced matrix element while \(  \)qja1,ja2,⋯,jakje1,⋯,jek-3 is a rank- k intertwiner of su(2) (generalized clebsch-gordan coefficient).
obviously, the tensor ( 14 ) of an mps is a special case of ( 18 ) for k = 3 (there are no intermediate indices, and the index σ decomposes trivially as \(  \)σ=(s,1,ms) or simply \(  \)σ=(s,ms) ).
a rank- k intertwiner may be decomposed into a product of c factors defined in equation ( 15 ).
different decompositions are possible and they may be represented as different coupling schemes as explained in more detail in [ 9 , 17 ].
here, we will choose coupling schemes which we find convenient for our purposes.
let us illustrate the construction of su(2) invariant tensors using an mpo tensor w as example.
such tensors have rank-4, therefore we need one intermediate index \(  \)e=(je,me) .
the mpo has two physical indices \(  \)(s,ms) and \(  \)(s,ms') (assuming that at each site there are particles with the same spin s ) and two virtual indices \(  \)(jtm) , \(  \)(j't'm') .
the w tensor is then decomposed as   with a rank-3 reduced tensor \(  \)and#x0e243;γ,γ'je (the factor \(  \)2s+1 is introduced for convenience in order to free the reduced unity tensor from an s dependence).
our definition of the reduced tensor corresponds to the coupling scheme shown in figure 3 .
we note that \(  \)te=1 because fusion of two equal spins s gives a non-degenerate spin.
due to the restrictions imposed by the structural c factors as well as the high sparseness of the mpo in its full form, many reduced tensor elements can be chosen to be zero, and the reduced tensor \(  \)and#x0e243; assumes a characteristic sparse structure.
this is demonstrated by the reduced tensor representations of the hamiltonians needed in the present paper given in appendix a .
we also provide a reduced representation for the h <sup>2</sup> operator in appendix d .
as was already stated, the w tensors of many important operators can be obtained exactly as well as their reduced tensor representation \(  \)and#x0e243; .
this representation is characterized by a degeneracy set \(  \)d={(j0,t0),…(jn,tn)} , e.g. for the bbh hamiltonian one finds \(  \)d={(0,3),(1,1),(2,1)} as is shown in appendix a .
similarly, one can expand higher rank tensors like the block tensors h and h into reduced tensors.
details are given in appendix b .
as a consequence, the optimization (update) step equation ( 6 ) can be formulated as a generalized eigenvalue problem in terms of the reduced effective hamiltonian \(  \)and#x0e234;eff and the reduced effective normalization matrix \(  \)and#x0e23a;eff (both given explicitly in equation ( c.1 ))   we stress again that the reduced normalization matrix arises due to pbc and both \(  \)and#x0e234;eff and \(  \)and#x0e23a;eff change at each iteration step.
the updated matrix \(  \)and#x0e239; is then obtained from a suitable partition of the vector ν into a matrix, \(  \)and#x0e239;γ,γ'=ν[γ'γ] as well as zeros for those tensor elements which do not fulfill the triangle rule.
details of the derivation of the optimization step in terms of reduced tensors are given in appendix c .
a reduced form of the projection operator p defined in equation ( 12 ) is also given there.
this enables the calculations of excited_states in different spin sectors.
the regauging step (equation ( 10 )) in terms of reduced tensors is briefly described in appendix e .
a first demonstration that the proposed algorithm works as expected is given in appendix f .
 calculation of observables.
if the operator o of an observable is su(2) invariant, its expectation value equation ( 4 ) can be calculated using reduced tensors only.
in the present paper we do not consider covariant operators.
using equation ( 3 ) for the operator and equation ( 17 ) for the wavefunction \(  \)|jm⟩ , one can write   the expectation values of the su(2) invariant operator are equal for different spin projections: \(  \)⟨jm|o|jm⟩=⟨jm'|o|jm'⟩ .
therefore, we can write   if the mps tensor f at the fictitious site is normalized such that \(  \)qr=1 .
for simplicity we did not label the mps matrices with their corresponding local spin index.
in the last line we have represented the expectation value as a reduced left block tensor as defined in appendix b .
it is this represenation which we use for a recursive calculation of expectation values using the formulas provided in appendix b .
an example of an su(2) invariant operator is the dimerization operator ( 22 ).
on the other hand, the string correlator ( 23 ) is not su(2) symmetric due to the parity factor \(  \)∏j=i+1i+l-1exp(iπsjz) .
for such operators a full mps needs to be reconstructed using ( 17 ), and the mpo in its full form must be used.
 bilinear-biquadratic spin-1 heisenberg model with pbcs.
in this section we present a numerical study of the spin-1 bbh model equation ( 1 ).
this model has been studied extensively in recent years, and we have given a number of pointers to the literature in the introduction.
the present study is distinguished by its particular treatment of su(2) symmetry in periodic systems.
with moderate computational effort and relatively small numbers of variational parameters we obtain results of high precision.
we present results for the low lying spectrum of the bbh model as well as for selected correlation functions.
in order to do calculations using the proposed algorithm one needs to choose an appropriate degeneracy set for the virtual spins.
the larger this set the larger is the computational effort.
an algorithmic procedure for automatic selection of a suitable degeneracy set is presently under development.
in order to select the degeneracy sets we cautiously use one entanglement measure for initial guidance.
obviously, for highly entangled states one needs large degeneracy sets with many virtual spins.
in order to estimate the entanglement of the states at different θ , we use exact diagonalization for a system of n = 10 spins and determine the negativity [ 56 ] of the ground_state to quantify nearest-neighbor qutrit-qutrit entanglement (see figure 4 ).
the negativity n is obtained from the reduced 2-qutrit density matrix ρ ,   where t denotes the partial transpose of ρ with respect to the first qutrit and \(  \)∥.∥ the trace norm.
it is obvious from figure 4 that bipartite entanglement is largest in the dimerized phase, while in the haldane phase and the critical phase the states are less strongly bipartite entangled.
therefore, we cautiously expect that the largest computational resources will be needed in the dimerized phase.
at the aklt point \(  \)θ=arctan13 there is a local entanglement minimum.
at this point we just need the trivial virtual spin representation \(  \){(1/2,1)} for a quasi-exact calculation for any system size.
the bi-partite entanglement vanishes at the point \(  \)θ=π/2 (which happens even for large systems).
at \(  \)θ=-3π/4 the negativity vanishes as well, however, at this point the ground_state is in fact highly entangled.
it resembles a state similar to the greenberger-horne-zeilinger state, which in fact is maximally entangled.
our choice for the virtual spin representations and their degeneracies is partly guided by these entanglement results.
the negativity shows characteristic singularities at various points, foreshadowing clearly already for n = 10 the phase structure one observes in the thermodynamic limit.
interestingly, there is a weak singularity at the heisenberg point \(  \)θ=0 , where there is no phase transition in the thermodynamic limit.
together with the bipartite entanglement we also plot in figure 4 the quantity \(  \)j/(2n) ( j is the total spin of the ground_state) for n = 10.
in the parameter region of the critical phase j = 1, while it is zero in all other phases except the ferromagnetic phase.
the mpss we construct are eigenstates of the bbh hamiltonian as well as eigenstates of the total angular momentum operator (therefore we label the states with angular momentum j ).
however, they are not necessarily eigenstates of quasi-momentum operator as well.
nevertheless, if the constructed eigenstates are non-degenerate (apart from the su(2) degeneracies), we determine in some cases the quasi-momentum of the constructed states and label the states and their energies with the momentum label p .
the operator t of the translation over n sites acts on an eigenstate with well-defined momentum p as   therefore, for such states \(  \)p=2πnp/n ( \(  \)np=0,…,n-1 ) can be determined from the expectation value of the translation operator, \(  \)⟨ψ|tn|ψ⟩=e-ipn , which is easily calculated in the mps framework using equation ( 4 ) and a cyclic shift of the mps tensors in \(  \)|ψ⟩ .
 ground state energy.
figure 5 shows results for the ground_state energies per site in the j = 0 and j = n sectors for n = 100 spins as a function of the parameter θ .
the 'global' ground_state, i.e. the lowest state of all spin sectors, is j = 0 except in the critical phase \(  \)14≪θ/π≪12 , where the 'global' ground_state is j = 1 for n = 100, and the ferromagnetic region .
due to the symmetry \(  \)h(θ)=-h(θ+π) the minimal and maximal eigen-energies are related by \(  \)emin(θ)=-emax(θ+π) (this maximal energy is also shown in figure 5 ).
with few exceptions we used the representation \(  \){(1/2,6),(3/2,6),(5/2,5)} in order to produce this plot.
note that results for n = 100 are rather close to the thermodynamic limit.
at \(  \)θ/π=-34,-12,-14,14,12 exact ground_state energies per site are known from bethe ansatz calculations.
we compare with these results in table 1 and find rather good agreement.
it is interesting that our numerical results are obtained using half-integer virtual spins only (we obtain similar values with integer virtual spins, however, at a somewhat larger numerical cost).
precise calculations are most resource intensive for the two su(3) symmetric points, \(  \)θ=π/4 and \(  \)θ=-3π/4 .
in particular, virtual spins \(  \)j=7/2 are necessary in the degeneracy set d in the vicinity of \(  \)θ=-3π/4 .
in the ferromagnetic region \(  \)12≪θ/π≪54 the bilinear-biquadratic spin-1 heisenberg model has a \(  \)2n+1 degenerate spin- n ground_state for any system size n .
it is possible to work out the ground_state energy analytically within the proposed mps algorithm as the virtual spin configuration is simply \(  \){(n/2,1)} .
we demonstrate this in appendix g .
 low lying spectrum.
while it is possible to extract much information on the phase structure from an analysis of the ground_state properties, in the present paper we will concentrate on the low lying excitation spectrum, and we will discuss the spectrum at selected points in the phase diagram.
we will emphasize characteristic differences of the low lying spectrum in different phases which show up already for finite systems.
the spectrum for a system of 50 sites within the range \(  \)-34≪θ≪12 is presented in figure 6 .
we include the lowest two spin-0 states, one or two spin-1 states and one spin-2 state.
the states are labeled by their momentum p in some cases.
we discuss the spectra in the various phases shown in figure 6 from right to left:
characteristically, in the critical phase \(  \)14≪θ/π≪12 the ground_state for 50 spins is doubly degenerate spin-1.
there is small gap to the lowest spin-2 state, and there are slightly larger gaps to two lowest spin-0 states.
consequently, the lowest excitation is expected to be quadrupolar in this phase, which confirms predictions for spin chains in [ 43 ].
our numerical results for the ground_state for the systems with 50 or 100 sites at \(  \)θ=0.4π agree quantitatively very well with predictions in [ 57 ] obtained by extrapolation of the results for relatively small systems.
the ground_state in the entire haldane phase \(  \)-14≪θ/π≪14 is j = 0, and the lowest excited_state is j = 1.
the gap between these two states remains finite in the thermodynamic limit (haldane gap).
numerical data for the j = 0 state and j = 1 state for a purely bi-linear heisenberg ring with n = 100 sites are given in table 2 .
from these results one obtains the haldane gap \(  \)δ=0.41096 as compared to \(  \)δ=0.41048 given in [ 25 , 58 ].
at the given precision n = 100 cannot be distinguished from infinite systems.
the calculated energy of the j = 0 state agrees well with the results from previous studies [ 59 , 60 ].
the data presented in figure 6 refer to 50 sites.
it is observed that at θ = 0 the first excited_state in the spin-0 sector lies much above the lowest spin-1 state, and it is nearly degenerate with the lowest spin-2 state (see also [ 58 ]).
the dimerized phase \(  \)-34≪θ/π≪-14 has been the subject of many investigations in the history of the bbh model, and we will address the calculation of the dimerization in the next subsection.
this phase is characterized by the fact that the first excited spin-0 state is lower than the lowest spin-1 and spin-2 states.
the spin-1 state is lower than the spin-2 state for \(  \)θ/π≫-12 but above this state for \(  \)θ/π≪-12 .
at \(  \)θ=-π/2 the lowest spin-1 and spin-2 states form a degenerate pair (see also [ 39 ]).
in the thermodynamic limit, the two lowest j = 0 states are degenerate, however with a finite gap to the lowest j = 1 or j = 2 states.
as shown in table 3 the calculated energies of the three lowest states at the biquadratic point \(  \)θ=-π/2 agree very well with the bethe ansatz calculations of sørensen and young [ 41 ].
according to the heuristic entanglement analysis presented in the introduction to this section we expect calculations to be rather 'hard' at this point.
and indeed, we need large degeneracy sets in order to achieve reasonable precision.
in the parameter region of the debated nematic phase close to \(  \)θ=-3π/4 pbc rings of \(  \)n≤16 sites were investigated in [ 45 ].
we extend this work for systems of up to 50 sites.
we observe that the lowest spin-2 state is significantly lower than the first excited spin-0 state as well as the lowest spin-1 state.
as a consequence, quadrupolar correlations increase strongly in this region as pointed out in [ 43 ].
one may be tempted to conjecture the existence of the separate phase in this region from our results.
however, in order to do so one must study the behavior of the spectrum in the thermodynamic limit, which we do using finite-size scaling analysis for the gaps \(  \)δ00 and \(  \)δ02 .
the conjecture of [ 44 ] about the existence of the gapped nematic phase (i.e., \(  \)δ00∞≫0 and \(  \)δ02∞=0 ) was rejected in earlier works [ 19 , 45 , 46 ].
in fact, these calculations suggest that \(  \)δ00∞=0 .
however, there exists still the possibility that \(  \)δ02∞=0 in a narrow region of \(  \)-34≪θ/π≲-0.7 .
earlier dmrg calculations for obc [ 43 ] were not able to resolve extremely small values of \(  \)δ02∞ .
from a finite size scaling analysis we obtain \(  \)δ00∞≲2×10-4 at \(  \)θ/π=-0.72 .
this suggests that the gap between the two lowest spin-0 states closes in agreement with earlier calculations.
in fact, \(  \)δ00(n) can be fitted very well by a power law \(  \)δ00(n)=bn-α .
in line with this, the dimerization remains finite, \(  \)d∞=(4±2)×10-3 , as discussed in more detail in the following subsection.
in contrast, \(  \)δ02(n) shows exponential behavior.
from a fit to our data we obtain a gap between the lowest spin-0 and the spin-2 states of size \(  \)δ02∞≃0.009 at \(  \)θ=-0.72π .
moreover, we observe a monotonic decrease of the scaled gap \(  \)nδ00(n) and a monotonic increase of the scaled gap \(  \)nδ02(n) with increasing of n , which also indicates the absence of a nematic state at this θ .
however, as pointed out in [ 48 ], the possibility of the existence of such a state even closer to \(  \)θ/π=-34 cannot be excluded.
calculations closer to the ferromagnetic region for larger systems are presently under way.
 correlation functions.
finally, we also calculate a few physically interesting correlations in the bbh model.
in the area \(  \)-3/4≪θ/π≪-1/4 we determine the dimerization correlator   shown for a system of n = 50 sites in figure 7 .
in fact, due to translational symmetry, the ground_state as well as the excited_states of a finite-size pbc ring are not dimerized.
in order to calculate the dimerization we take a symmetric/antisymmetric superposition of the lowest two j = 0 states with different momenta.
these two states are separated by a very small gap for finite systems, and they should develop into the degenerate doublet in the thermodynamic limit.
the dimer order parameter calculated in this way is  
the dimerization d can be calculated analytically for \(  \)θ=-π/2 in the thermodynamic limit, where the bbh model can be mapped to a spin-1/2 xxz model.
according to [ 61 , 62 ] \(  \)d=52∏n=1∞tanh2narccosh32≃0.5622 , which agrees with the monte-carlo result of [ 41 ].
we fitted our results for 30, 40 and 50 sites at \(  \)θ=-π/2 by a function given in equation (6) of [ 48 ]:   the fit gives \(  \)d∞≃0.568 in good agreement with the theory, and \(  \)ξ≃20.2 .
calculations for larger systems (about 100 sites) are needed to obtain a more precise result.
the dimer order parameter ( 22 ) was calculated in [ 45 ] for finite chains of up to 48 sites.
in such obc calculations there is no translational symmetry, and the degenerate doublet is mixed automatically.
for systems of up to 50 sites the results for pbc are always slightly larger than for obc.
there are also calculations of the dimerization for spin rings in [ 21 ], however for the four-point correlator \(  \)⟨0(0)|d2|0(0)⟩ .
our extrapolated result for \(  \)θ=-0.65π is consistent with the result of [ 21 ].
finally we come back again to the haldane phase: this phase is characterized by the presence of a non-zero string correlator of the ground spin-0 state [ 63 ],   that does not decay in the limit \(  \)n,l⇒∞ .
figure 8 shows the string correlator \(  \)g(l) as a function of θ .
the system size is n = 100, and the string length is taken as l = 30.
this choice allows sufficient length of both the string and the rest of the system, in order to resemble the infinite-system properties (numerical results indicate that \(  \)g(l) is constant to a high degree for \(  \)20≤l≤40 ).
our results in the range \(  \)-0.2≤θ/π≤0.2 agree quantitatively very well with infinite-size calculations presented in [ 64 ].
our numerical calculations indicate that long-ranged string order is present in the haldane phase only (however, it is numerically hard to obtain precise values at the boundaries of the haldane phase).
the string correlator for the aklt point ( \(  \)θ=arctan1/3 ) can be calculated exactly [ 35 ]: \(  \)g(∞)=4/9 , which is reproduced extremely well in our calculation for n = 100 sites.
the curve has the maximum at this point.
the best estimate for a string correlator for the bilinear heisenberg spin-1 model ( \(  \)θ=0 ) is \(  \)g(∞)≃0.374325 [ 2 ].
our result \(  \)g(30)=0.374330 calculated for a system size of n = 100 spins agrees very well with this value.
 conclusions.
in the present work we developed an algorithm for su(2) symmetric mpss with pbcs that involves only reduced tensor elements.
it was applied to a study of the lowest-lying states of the spectrum of the spin-1 bbh model of up to 100 sites.
the characteristic differences of the spectrum in the various phases of the model were stressed.
dimerization and string order were studied in the dimerized and haldane phase, respectively.
our results agree rather well with previous studies based on dmrg or bethe ansatz calculations, and we could extend previous studies to a more complete coverage of the full parameter range, in particular in the dimerized phase close to the transition to the ferromagnetic phase.
we confirm the absence of a nematic phase for \(  \)θ/π≫-0.72 within our numerical precision.
the precision of the results we can achieve with our implementation of the algorithm depends on the degeneracy set d we choose for the representation of the virtual spin indices of the mps.
due to fact that we have eliminated all spin projection indices, our algorithm achieves rather large 'effective' virtual spin dimensions in comparison to a non-symmetric implementation.
e.g. a state with reduced mps dimension m = 30 described by the degeneracy set \(  \)d={(0,6),(1/2,6),(1,6),(3/2,6),(2,6)} corresponds to an effective mps virtual dimension m = 90, which is already rather large for a pbc calculation.
moreover, due to the sparse structure of each mps reduced tensor, such a state is described by only 288 complex parameters per site compared to 16200 complex parameters per site necessary to specify a non-symmetric state.
the number of parameters is also roughly one order smaller than for a u(1) symmetric state.
for this state about 98% of the parameters used in a non-symmetric calculation are actually zero due to symmetry.
as a consequence, the numerical effort for the solution of the generalized eigenvalue problem at each update step is reduced correspondingly.
in fact, we suspect that the states determined without explicit consideration of the symmetry are incorrect even though their energy is determined precisely.
this needs to be investigated in more detail in future work.
of course, the numerical effort to be expected grows with the size of the chosen degeneracy set d .
and at this stage this set is fixed from the start of our calculation.
it would be desirable that the algorithm dynamically chooses this set according to suitable algorithmic criteria.
the implementation of such a procedure is under way using ideas presented in [ 59 ] and discussed for pbc in [ 55 ].
