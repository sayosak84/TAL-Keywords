superconductivity in a two-dimensional repulsive rashba_gas at low electron density
total density_of states (dos) ; renormalization group (rg) ; time reversal symmetry (trs) ; 
	we study the superconducting instability and the resulting superconducting states in a two-dimensional repulsive fermi gas with rashba spin-orbit coupling at low electron density (namely the fermi energy ef is lower than the energy er of the dirac point induced by rashba coupling).
	we find that superconductivity is enhanced as the dimensionless fermi energy ϵ f ( ϵ f ≡ e f / e r ) decreases, due to two reasons.
	first, the density of states at ϵ f increases as 1 / ϵ f .
	second, the particle-hole bubble becomes more anisotropic, resulting in an increasing effective attraction.
	the superconducting state is always in the total angular momentum j z = + 2 (or j z = - 2 ) channel with chern_number c = 4 (or c = - 4 ), breaking time reversal symmetry spontaneously.
	although a putative leggett mode is expected due to the two-gap nature of the superconductivity, we find that it is always damped.
	more importantly, once a sufficiently large zeeman coupling is applied to the superconducting state, the chern_number can be tuned to be ±1 and majorana zero modes exist in the vortex cores.
despite an effect originating from relativity, spin-orbit coupling (soc) has found its way into nonrelativistic physics.
in condensed matter physics, novel systems with soc playing a significant role are found recently, such as topological insulators [1, 2], two-dimensional (2d) rashba_gases at interfaces of oxides [3, 4], weyl semimetals [5] and soc-induced mott insulators [6] and other states in 5d series [7]; while in ultracold quantum gases, although atoms are neutral, synthetic soc can be generated by atom-light interaction (see [8, 9] for review).
turning to superconductivity, non-centrosymmetric superconductors, where soc mixes spin singlet and triplet pairings, have been extensively studied [10-14]; and in 2d, superconductivity related to soc was observed at oxide interfaces [4, 15].
here, we study a 2d repulsive gas with rashba soc at low density.
the single-particle hamiltonian is 1 h = k 2 2 m + α r ( σ and #x020d7; × k ) · n ˆ , where m is the effective mass, α r characterizes the strength of rashba soc, σ and #x020d7; 's components are pauli matrices, and n ˆ is the direction normal to the 2d system.
by a unitary transformation to helicity basis, one finds the dispersion 2 e k λ = ( k - λ k r ) 2 2 m , where λ = ± 1 is the helicity and k r = m α r is the rashba momentum.
(we have shifted the energy by k r 2 / ( 2 m ) , which will be compensated by the shift of the fermi energy.)
the spin degeneracy is lifted, resulting in two bands touching at a dirac point.
in this system, the competition between the three energy scales-the fermi energy ef, coulomb repulsion and the 'rashba energy' e r = k r 2 / ( 2 m ) -determines the system's phases.
we define the dimensionless fermi energy by ϵ f = e f / e r .
by 'low density', we refer to the regime 0 < ϵ f < 1 , as shown in figure 1(a).
while in the low-density limit, the fermi energy is much smaller than coulomb interaction and soc energy, and wigner crystalline phases are found [16], we focus on the weak-coupling limit un tot < 1 (although n tot ~ 1 / ϵ f as discussed below), where u is the short-range repulsion and ntot is the total density of states (dos) at fermi energy.
we investigate the instability of the system to superconducting states.
in earlier papers [17, 18], the 'high density' case with ϵ f > 1 was studied.
it was found that as ϵ f decreases from a large value to 1, in general, superconductivity is enhanced, and the total angular momentum channel jz in which cooper pairs condense decreases from a large value as an arithmetic sequence with a step of 2.
finally, at ϵ f ≳ 1 , jz becomes 2.
the superconductivity predominantly resides on the outer fermi surface, and interband coupling induces a small gap on the inner fermi surface.
the superconducting state breaks time reversal symmetry (trs), and both fermi surfaces are fully gapped.

at low density, the fermi level indicated by the dashed line is below the dirac point at energy er. (b) the two fermi surfaces, the annulus between which is filled by electrons with helicity +1.
the black arrows represent the direction of the spins around the fermi surfaces.
a topological change of the fermi surface occurs at ϵ f = 1 , below which is the 'low density' regime we are interested in.
as shown in figure 1(b), there is an electron-like and a hole-like fermi surface, between which the annulus is filled by electrons.
the fermi wave vectors (rescaled by kr) are k f µ = 1 + µ ϵ f , where µ = 1 or -1, corresponding to the outer and inner fermi surface, respectively.
note that the two fermi surfaces have the same helicity λ = 1 .
the dos at the fermi surface is n µ = ν 0 ( 1 ϵ f + µ ) , where ν 0 = m / ( 2 π ) .
it is likely that superconductivity is further enhanced, since the total dos increases with decreasing ϵ f as n tot ~ 1 / ϵ f .
in addition, we wonder what a topological change of the fermi surfaces may bring about to the dielectric functions, which can give rise to the attraction in nonzero jz channels.
the enhancement of conventional superconductivity in attractive rashba_gases at low density has been studied in [19], while here we address the problem with repulsion, which leads to unconventional superconductivity.
following the renormalization group (rg) approach developed in [17, 18], we find that at low density, the superconducting instability always occurs in jz = 2 channel, and the critical temperature tc increases with decreasing ϵ f .
the increasing could be of many orders of magnitude, although the resulting tc is still quite low due to the weak coupling nature of our formalism.
a recent theme in condensed matter physics is to search for majorana fermions in various systems [20].
in addition to intrinsic chiral p-wave superconductors [21-24], spin-orbit coupled systems, such as topological insulators [25], semiconductors with zeeman splitting in proximity to s-wave superconductors [26] and hole-doped semiconductors [27] also support majorana fermion modes in the vortex cores.
we show that the intrinsic superconducting state we have found can also host majorana fermions once a sufficiently large zeeman field is applied, and the topological phase diagram is derived.
we also study the collective modes in the superconducting state.
due to the two-gap nature, in addition to the usual bogoliubov-anderson-goldstone (bag) mode which is pushed to plasma energy, a collective mode corresponding to the oscillation of the phase difference of the two gaps, the leggett mode, could also exist.
however, the values of the interband and intraband couplings in the whole parameter regime do not support an undamped leggett mode.
 methods.
 perturbative expansion and rg approach.
we study the system with onsite repulsive interactions, the interacting hamiltonian of which is   where u is positive.
the interacting hamiltonian in the helicity basis reads [ 17 , 18 ]   where \(  \)akµ is the annihilation operator in the helicity basis and \(  \)θk is the angle of \(  \)k .
following the weak-coupling rg approach developed in [ 17 , 18 ] and integrating out high energy modes from the bandwidth a to a low-energy cutoff ω, we derive the effective action for the low energy modes   where \(  \)β=1/(kbt) and a 's and a <sup>*</sup> 's are grassmann numbers.
we have focused on the cooper channel, the couplings of which are the only (marginally) relevant ones [ 36 ], and decomposed the couplings into angular momentum channels, where \(  \)φ=θk'-θk .
since in j = 0 channel, u dominates, one cannot get attractive interactions.
therefore, we go to higher orders and look for nonvanishing terms in higher angular momentum channels.
at second order, we have particle-hole bubble and particle-particle bubble, the latter of which only has j = 0 component.
the correction from the particle-hole bubble (shown in figure 6 (a)) is \(  \)u226(π(k,k')-π(-k,k')) , where the dielectric function is   where   since cooper pairs are expected to form between electrons near the fermi surfaces, \(  \)k and \(  \)k' are restricted to be at fermi surface µ and λ , respectively.
straightforward calculations show that \(  \)π(k,k') can be written in the form   where \(  \)λµλ(ϵf,cosφ) is a real function that depends on the dimensionless fermi energy \(  \)ϵf , but not on e and e independently.
then the renormalized coupling appearing in equation ( 5 ) reads   where \(  \)vµλ(jz) is the j th fourier component of \(  \)λµλ(s)(ϵf,cosφ)≡12(λµλ(ϵf,cosφ)+λµλ(ϵf,-cosφ)) .
the functions \(  \)λµλ(s)(ϵf,cosφ) are plotted in figure 7 .
at \(  \)ϵf→1- , \(  \)λ++(s) and \(  \)λ--(s) connect with the same functions at \(  \)ϵf→1+ calculated in [ 17 , 18 ], but \(  \)λ+-(s) changes sign due to the change of the helicity of the inner fermi surface.
clearly, the functions depend more strongly on φ at smaller \(  \)ϵf .
up to the fourth order of u , there is only one term that satisfies two conditions: (i) being finite in nonzero angular momentum channel; and (ii) having a logarithmic divergence \(  \)ln(a/ω) , which may give rise to an instability.
this term is shown in figure 6 (b).
including it, the renormalized couplings become   defining the dimensionless bare coupling \(  \)gµλ(jz)=u2m16nµnλvµλ(jz) and the dimensionless renormalized coupling \(  \)gµλr(jz)=2nµnλvµλr(jz) , we find the rg flow equation   where '*' is the matrix multiplication, and the bare couplings have been replaced by the renormalized couplings.
the solution is   with the initial condition   the scale of the superconducting transition temperature is given by the largest energy at which the renormalized coupling diverges   where j is chosen in such a way that, at a given \(  \)ϵf , \(  \)g-(jz0) is the most negative among all the \(  \)g±(jz) 's.
we find that as long as \(  \)ϵf<1 , \(  \)|jz0|≡2 , although it increases in general with \(  \)ϵf when \(  \)ϵf>1 [ 17 , 18 ].
the intraband and intraband couplings are shown in figure 2 .
the effective coupling \(  \)g-(jz0) is plotted in figures 3 and 4 in units of \(  \)u2ν02 and \(  \)u2ntot2 , respectively.
 results.
 effective couplings and critical temperature.
the critical temperature is given by   where a is the bandwidth, \(  \)jz0≡2 and \(  \)g-(jz) is the effective coupling in j channel, given by   where \(  \)v++(jz) and \(  \)v--(jz) are the intraband couplings on the outer and inner bands, respectively, and \(  \)v+-(jz) is the interband coupling.
they are shown in figure 2 in j = 2 channel.
as can be seen, \(  \)v-- and \(  \)v+- are negligible above \(  \)ϵf~0.5 , and superconductivity predominantly resides on the outer fermi surface; and the inner fermi surface participates only at quite low density.
the effective coupling \(  \)g-(jz0) is plotted in figures 3 and 4 in units of \(  \)u2ν02 and \(  \)u2ntot2 , respectively.
although it seems \(  \)|g-(jz0)| can acquire any large value from figure 3 , in our weak-coupling rg approach, the result is not justified for \(  \)untot≳1 , and we see from figure 4 that the effective coupling is still restricted to be small in the justifiable parameter regime.
however, t can increase by many orders of magnitude as \(  \)ϵf decreases.
if u is fixed, a superconductor-insulator transition is expected as the density of the gas decreases since wigner crystal state should exist at strong coupling [ 16 ], but we are not concerned with this case.
 topological phase diagram with zeeman field.
as discussed in [ 17 , 18 ], the ground_state breaks trs spontaneously and the system goes to either j = 2 or \(  \)jz=-2 superconducting state, both of which have the same energy.
due to soc, the paring term in the hamiltonian has both triplet and singlet part, which reads   where \(  \)δt and \(  \)δs are the triplet and singlet pairing strength, respectively, and \(  \)θk is the angle between \(  \)k and k -axis.
to search for majorana fermions, instead of solving the bogoliubov-de gennes equations in the presence of vortices, we apply an index theorem proved in [ 28 ] that superconductors with an odd chern_number can support majorana zero modes.
in [ 17 , 18 ], the chern_number c of this state has been shown to be 2 jz if \(  \)ef>er , and 0 if \(  \)ef<er .
to have an odd c , we apply a zeeman field h [ 26 , 29 , 30 ] which couples to the system as   since now the hamiltonian breaks trs, the two states with \(  \)jz=±2 have different energies.
as pointed in [ 29 ], if \(  \)hz<0 , the system favors j = 2 state; and if \(  \)hz>0 , it favors \(  \)jz=-2 state.
these two cases are related by time reversal operation, so we just consider the former case.
we calculate the chern_number and find three topological phases, depending on the position of fermi level and h , as shown in figure 5 .
the topological phase diagram can be explained as follows.
when \(  \)hz<0 , the dirac point is gapped, and chern_number is well defined for each band in the superconducting state.
due to the winding of spin around \(  \)k=0 , the band with helicity -1 (+1) carries chern_number 1 (-1).
in addition, the phase winding of the order parameter superimposes j to the chern_number of each band.
therefore, the inner and outer band carry chern_number \(  \)jz+1 and \(  \)jz-1 , respectively.
when \(  \)ef-er>|hz| , the fermi level crosses both bands, and the chern_number is the sum of the two, \(  \)c=2jz .
when \(  \)ef-er<-|hz| , the fermi level either crosses the outer band twice, in which case the electron pocket and hole pocket contribute opposite chern_number, thus c = 0, or does not cross any band and hence c = 0.
between these two parameter regimes, i.e. when \(  \)|hz|>|ef-er| , the fermi level only crosses the outer band, and then \(  \)c=jz-1 .
in this case, according to the index theorem mentioned above, majorana zero modes exist at the edge and in the vortex cores.
at low density, only the left part of the phase diagram in figure 5 (b) is available.
 collective modes.
collective modes in superconductors were first studied by bogoliubov [ 31 ] and anderson [ 32 , 33 ].
they found a goldstone mode accompanying the spontaneous breaking of u (1) gauge symmetry in a neutral system, which corresponds to the phase oscillations of the superconducting order parameter.
in a charged system, this so called bag mode is pushed up to the plasma frequency.
in two-band superconductors, leggett predicted another collective mode corresponding to the oscillations of the relative phase of the two superconducting condensates [ 34 ].
in the superconducting state derived above, due to the two-gap nature, in addition to bag mode, leggett mode is also expected to exist.
the detailed calculations are carried out in the supplemental material.
effectively, in j = 2 channel, we have a two-band p + i p superconductor.
actually, if the bare interaction were attractive, superconductivity would occur in j = 0 channel, and the superconducting state would also have a two-band p + i p nature.
thus our approach also applies to that case.
we find both bag and leggett modes, while the former is pushed to plasma energy, the latter has a dispersion   where     in the above, n 's are the dos, \(  \)gµλ~vµλ , and   where n is the total particle number in band λ , and \(  \)λ=1,2 labels the outer and inner band.
note that the second term in equation ( 21 ) does not appear in a two-band s -wave superconductor.
in order for leggett mode to exist, it is necessary for \(  \)ω02 to be positive, hence \(  \)g11g22-g122>0 .
however, the whole parameter regime shown in figure 2 does not satisfy this condition, thus this mode must be damped in our model.
but in other soc superconductors, leggett mode could exist [ 35 ].
 discussion and conclusion.
looking for various ways to increase the critical temperature of superconductors is an important direction in condensed matter physics.
we showed that increasing rashba soc or decreasing the fermi energy can strongly enhance superconductivity in a 2d repulsive fermi gas in the low density regime.
as shown in figure 4 , if we assume un is fixed to be \(  \)≲1 , the effective attraction can be increased by ten times by decreasing \(  \)ϵf , resulting in a much higher t than that in the high density regime.
although such superconductivity is still too weak to observe in our weak-coupling approach, we wonder if soc helps in strongly correlated systems, which is worthy of further study.
in real materials, the underlying lattice will affect the model in several aspects.
the dos is suppressed: although increasing with lowering \(  \)ϵf , it will not diverge.
the particle-hole bubble will also be affected.
due to these two consequences, the behavior of t will be modified, but the trend that t increases with lowering \(  \)ϵf will probably remain the same.
moreover, the spontaneous trs breaking state may not be stable unless the two pairing components of the j = 2 state, d and \(  \)dx2-y2 order parameter, belong to the same irreducible representation of the point group, which can be satisfied if the lattice has a threefold rotational symmetry.
in conclusion, we have investigated the superconducting instability of a 2d rashba_gas with repulsive interaction at low density, in the weak-coupling limit.
as the density decreases, the superconducting transition temperature increases significantly.
the superconducting state is always in j = 2 channel.
when a zeeman field is applied, the state can have an odd chern_number, and hence majorana zero modes are supported.
although leggett mode does not exist due to the specific parameters, we expect it to appear in other spin-orbit coupled superconductors because of the two-gap nature.
