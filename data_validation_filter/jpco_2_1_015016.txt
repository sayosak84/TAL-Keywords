teaching renormalization scaling and universality with an example from quantum mechanics we discuss the quantum mechanics of a particle restricted to the half line x with potential energy v x for it is known that two scale invariant theories may be defined by regularizing the near origin behavior of the potential by a finite square well with variable width b and depth g it is shown how these two scale invariant theories occupy fixed points in the resulting b g space of hamiltonians a renormalization group rg flow exists in this space and scaling variables are shown to exist in a neighborhood of the fixed points consequently the propagator of the regulated theory enjoys homogeneous scaling laws close to the fixed points using rg arguments it is possible to discern the functional form of the propagator for long distances and long imaginary times thus demonstrating the extent to which fixed points control the behavior of the cut off theory by keeping the width fixed and varying only the well depth we show how the mean position of a bound state diverges as g approaches a critical value it is proven that the exponent characterizing the divergence is universal in the sense that its value is independent of the choice of regulator two classical interpretations of the results are discussed standard brownian motion on the real line and the free energy of a certain one dimensional chain of particles with prescribed boundary conditions in the former example v appears as part of an expectation value in the feynman kac formula in the latter example v appears as the background potential for the chain and the loss of extensivity is dictated by a universal power law introduction the inverse square potential in quantum mechanics has a rich history that continues to be upa common thread running through these applications and the reason for our interest is that the attractive x potential is a fascinating case study that naturally calls upon the framework of the renormalization group rg we will see that the rg approach mirrors in many ways the modern treatment of quantum effective field theories whereby one demands that long distance observables remain insensitive to the adjustment of fine details at short distances the purpose of this article is twofold it is primarily a pedagogical treatment of renormalization in the context of single particle quantum mechanics and it is intended for teachers of quantum field theory we feel that the example presented herein can provide an instructive introduction to basic rg ideas and terminology because our rg analysis involves a quantum theory where one maintains full nonperturbative control teachers may find that it serves as a useful aid for the beginning graduate student who is learning field theoretic renormalization but having difficulty separating the core principles from the technology required to do perturbative renormalization with many degrees of freedom we should mention that other pedagogical presentations of the renormalization of the inverse square potential exist readers may wish to consult for additional background however in these works they study the case the other purpose of the article is to continue exploring the implications of the rg results uncovered in the work of kaplan et al see footnote although their work is certainly not the first instance in which the inverse square potential is discussed it is notable for among other things discussions of the beta function operator anomalous dimensions at the fixed points and the general phenomenon of conformal to non conformal phase transitions in particular we follow up their understanding of the fixed point structure with a natural extension to the quantum mechanical propagator and we use well known quantum classical equivalences to extract statistical lessons for specific one dimensional classical systems consider a particle in one spatial dimension subject to the potential for we work in units where so that energy is the reciprocal of time and m so that energy is also the reciprocal of length squared this means that time and length squared have equivalent dimensions in these units is a dimensionless number whose value we do not imagine changing in any of our analyses the paper is organized as follows in section we explain why the choice although giving perfectly consistent dynamics is still peculiar we then explain that two distinct hilbert spaces may be defined in section the hamiltonian is modified at short distances at the expense of a dimensionful length scale and a coupling constant so that these two hilbert spaces meld into one in section we discuss how the process of renormalization allows one to continuously vary the short distance modification without affecting a long distance observable this naturally leads to the construction of the propagator in section and analysis of its properties in section when there is a continuous spectrum in section we analyze the low energy discrete spectrum when it exists classical applications of quantum mechanics are given in section finding these applications were in fact the original source of motivation for this work in section remarks that generalize the inverse square potential to three dimensions and are given since this paper is part pedagogical guide part research a remark about which portions are novel is in order sections follow the path set forth set forth in footnote although we provide a different interpretation of the fixed points than in that work to the best of our knowledge sections are new lastly some of the remarks made in section briefly summarize what is already well established in the literature regarding the renormalization of the case pure inverse square potential does the hamiltonian given by h p v x define a sensible quantum theory to answer this question one may proceed to construct the physical hilbert space of states and x e over which the operators x p and h are self adjoint it is important to remember that the self adjointness property is not inherent to a differential expression for an operator one must also consider the vector space of functions on which it acts and the boundary conditions satisfied by those functions and so it should be stressed that the physical hilbert space is not necessarily the space of square integrable complex valued functions l equipped with the standard inner product while this is a bonafide hilbert space in the functional analysis sense and is consistent with the degrees of freedom available to a single spinless particle moving along a line it is not necessarily the physical hilbert space because certain functions exist whose behavior at x or x ruin the hermiticity of observables nevertheless it is certainly true that and x e l we shall construct and x e by forming linear combinations of the eigenfunctions of h it is crucial that and x e be complete with respect to the distance function inherited from the inner product so that any cauchy sequence built from elements of and x e converge in l sup sup norm to a limit also in and x e this is guaranteed according to sturm liouville theory for a self adjoint hamiltonian the position operator x is already self adjoint in the space l the momentum operator p is self adjoint if and only if f g for any f g and x e the energy operator h is self adjoint if and only if f g f g both of these conditions arise as boundary terms resulting from an integration by parts in trying to establish the equality of f and x e b g and and x e b f g the general solution to the eigenvalue equation may be constructed as a linear combination of two frobenius series for e and x e the solution is c x c x where are the roots of the characteristic equation we note that the range implies so both solutions satisfy we will see that the regularity of both solutions is what makes the quantum mechanics of the inverse square potential so interesting it is straightforward to construct eigenfunctions of h using series and it turns out that they define ordinary or modified bessel functions the simplest way to see this is to define a dimensionless variable x e and let the resulting ode for is a variant of bessel s equation for e there is a unique linear combination of the independent solutions with c c that exhibits asymptotic exponential decay and is therefore square integrable namely e x k e x here k is a modified bessel function of the second kind such an eigenfunction is inadmissible as an element of and x e for several related reasons the scale invariance of the eigenvalue equation implies that if e is a normalized state then so is e e x for but that would indicate a continuum of square integrable states a situation which directly contradicts the feynman hellmann theorem as is not an explicit parameter of h furthermore e and e are not orthogonal when most damning of all by scaling we can make e arbitrarily negative so there is no ground state the root of these problems lie in the fact that e fails to satisfy the required boundary conditions generally a solution to equation that is also square integrable vanishes at spatial infinity and has vanishing first derivative in addition e also vanishes at the origin therefore p is self adjoint with regard to such eigenfunctions however self adjointness of h requires but essentially hermiticity fails because both near origin solutions x are acceptable one can force the self adjointness of h by artificially introducing another boundary condition to select one solution or the other or by modifying the near origin behavior of the potential for e a continuum of eigenfunctions exist both signs satisfy the important closure relation ek x ek y dk x y since the order of the bessel function is greater than since both positive and negative orders give independent representations of the identity operator we have the freedom to use either sign in forming physical states that is consider the subspace of l whose elements may be expressed as here we assume that f fand x so that the integral exists by plancherel s theorem this describes an inverse hankel transform a function constructed by this kind of superposition inherits the same near origin behavior as that of the bessel j function to wit near the origin ek x e x notice that the dependence on e and x is separable therefore in an integral of the form g e ek x de where the x dependence is parametric the result will be proportional to x this ensures that h is self adjoint and that one obtains two possible hilbert spaces and x e depending on the sign chosen in the order of the bessel function a final remark e is the infimum of the eigenvalues but strictly speaking there is no zero energy eigenstate there is a simple physical argument that explains why the hilbert space is not unique imagine scattering a de broglie wave of fixed energy e coming from x this is somewhat artificial since we should really speak in terms of a normalizable wave packet but such extra rigor does not change the essential conclusion for x k the wavefunction takes the form e ikx reikx it should be possible to express the reflection amplitude r in terms of c c however there is no condition that determines the value of c c itself ordinarily a boundary condition like suffices to fix the ratio of coefficients of linearly independent solutions in this situation rules out neither x nor x breaking scale invariance our goal is to connect the two scale invariant theories and x e in the wilsonian sense by linking them in a continuous space of hamiltonians however the kind of explicit symmetry breaking needed in v must take place at x and must be sufficient to resolve the singularity when framed as a two body problem in three dimensions it is obvious that near origin is synonymous with short distance i e nearly coincident particles before moving on it is worth mentioning what happens if v is modified at long distances instead of short distances for example one analytically attractive method is to add a harmonic trap x here serves as an explicit length scale miraculously there exist raising and lowering operators that create two entirely independent ladders of states with equally spaced rungs or imagine a hard wall at some position x l this imposes a quantization of energies related to the zeros of the bessel j function the zeros may be those of j or j which are in general distinct regularizing with a square well modify the potential in equation so that it reads where g and b are dimensionless parameters and we regard x as a fixed length scale as usual hermiticity of the momentum and kinetic energy operators id dx and d dx constrain a wavefunction and its derivative to exist and be everywhere continuous even at the jump discontinuity in v our expressions are naturally stated in terms of a dimensionless wavenumber discrete eigenfunctions let e the exact bound state eigenfunction is the allowed energies follow from constants a and c are fixed by continuity and normalization imagine graphing each side of equation with respect to the left side is monotone increasing but the right side is monotone decreasing thus a root occurs only if the left side starts somewhere below or at the starting point of the right side by making use of the identity lim k k the root obtains when gcotg let us denote the solution to this equation by g therefore a valid bound state exists when g g continuum eigenfunctions let e the exact eigenfunction is the implicit energy equation is where primes denote derivatives with respect to the whole argument it is important to note that although we have chosen to write these expressions using the notation of bessel functions the analyses in this article rely on little more than the first couple terms in their power series for small argument suppose we wish either c or c to vanish using the identity lim j j equation becomes as b gcotg denote the roots of this equation as g that is since gcotg is monotonically decreasing for g it follows that g g for instance if then g and g the explicit formula for the ratio c c is assume that e is fixed for any desired positive value of c c there is a corresponding value of g g g we will primarily be interested in the analytical form of the ratio for small b or equivalently then we have established that for g g g every eigenfunction e will involve a well defined linear combination of the fundamental solutions characterized by a finite and nonzero value for c c in particular c c scales as e for fixed b and g renormalizing the coupling c c consider a point in the space of hamiltonians parametrized by the b g plane we would like to preserve the quantity c c as b is taken to zero in order to do this g must vary too the physical motivation for preserving c c is as will be discussed later its direct relation to the scattering phase shift and indirect relation to the binding energy these are low energy observables that may be measured at spatial infinity take equation for fixed e and small nominal b as b decreases further the factor increases and so c c remains constant only if gcotg gcotg approaches zero from below shrinking b ought to be understood as a flow to the infrared why the position of a particle at x can be said to be neither close to the origin nor far unless a comparison is made to some length scale v as given by equation lacks such a scale but introducing the cutoff bx in equation makes it possible to judge whether a physical distance is small or large for instance for a nominal value of b x x indicates that the particle is close to the origin while x x indicates that it is far in three dimensions for a fixed spatial separation x between two particles rescaling the cutoff from x to bx makes the distance between the particles larger in units of the cutoff that is x bx increases as b decreases this is precisely the regime one must examine to understand the long distance behavior of the interaction the infrared flow described by b takes a coupling g within the interval g g and makes it tend toward the root of gcotg in other words g g the precise manner by which g needs adjustment is called renormalization this indicates that b g g is the infrared attractive fixed point irfp of the flow this is depicted in figure we have learned that the irfp corresponds to the eigenfunction when c why does this make sense recall that both of the fundamental solutions to the schr dinger equation with v given by equation satisfy the boundary condition thus any linear combination of the fundamental set is acceptable near the origin once a regulator is introduced take b say and a unique linear combination is chosen up to scalar multiplication we may ask in generic terms how should the coefficients of these solutions be adjusted so that the appropriate c sup sup matching can be done at the cutoff scale x assuming that x e the solution x dominates over x near the cutoff because in other words x changes more rapidly than x does for small x as such if one desires to have a scattering phase shift dictated by the x solution then one must finely tune the coefficient c to be zero therefore from the point of view of x x the phase shift is generically dictated by the x solution whereas the x solution is rather special let us be precise about how g must change as b does we work in the limit of small b a certain change of variables makes the analysis elegant see footnote then for a given e and b up to a multiplicative factor independent of b from the invariance condition d c c db we obtain a rg equation which is exact in the b limit consider db for the right hand side of equation denoted and called the beta function is positive and so d thus is the irfp while is an infrared repulsive fixed point or equivalently an ultraviolet attractive fixed point uvfp this is consistent with what we discovered in terms of the parameter g there are two fixed points it is both interesting and particularly simple to study the behavior of close to a zero of the beta function here a scaling behavior emerges let b indicate the coupling associated to some choice of b let b b for some infinitesimal it follows that b b let b so b b d db b differentiate with respect to to obtain d d at a zero of the beta function the coupling does not change one hypothesizes that the reduced coupling obeys a simple scaling in the vicinity of the zero y in the language of the rg the difference is called a scaling variable and the exponent y is called an rg eigenvalue but this implies d d y equating both expressions for d d implies that y the rg eigenvalue is equal to the slope of the beta function at the fixed point specifically so y for a nice way to summarize what we have found is to define a reduced coupling in the vicinity of each fixed point note that g g g maps to near the irfp define u then since u u we learn that u is an irrelevant variable that tends to shrink as one enlarges the system near the uvfp define u then since u u we learn that u is a relevant variable that tends to grow the assignment of the descriptions irrelevant and relevant to equations and might sound backwards to the reader familiar with real space renormalization but are in fact consistent for instance the real space approach assigns irrelevant scaling variables negative rg eigenvalues not positive ones like ours this is because the sense by which one progresses to long distances in say a discrete lattice model is a bit different on the lattice there is a spacing a which cannot be adjusted instead one coarse grains over successively larger chunks of the infinite lattice each step producing an intermediate lattice with larger effective size a a for such procedure reduces the measure of the dimensionless correlation length and is a way of probing successively longer physical distances a coupling obeying the relation u u ylat for ylat is then said to be irrelevant because it shrinks this is equivalent to the reduction b b used in our analysis of the inverse square potential since any physical distance x grows bigger in units of the cutoff scale bx lastly it is worth reframing the scaling in terms of the original coupling g by the same logic as above it should be that near a fixed point g g g g yanddiacriticaltilde where yanddiacriticaltilde g one should not confuse g with g rather g bdgdb bdgd d db g by the inverse function theorem as long as g differentiating with respect to g yields g g g however at a fixed point so the extra term vanishes and we have g or yanddiacriticaltilde y hence the reduced coupling g g is irrelevant and g g is relevant with exactly the same rg eigenvalues as in equations and scattering phase shift one may also frame the renormalization condition as the requirement that the relative phase between incoming and outgoing plane waves remain invariant as one varies the wavelength let kbx for small we find that d d with exactly the same beta function as in equation the salient details are presented in an appendix there are two ways to interpret the findings i one could regard the cutoff b as held fixed at some nominal value and imagine varying k observe the phase shift experimentally for some k the value so obtained locates a unique point in the g plane taking the long wavelength limit k and hence requires adjusting g so that one remains on a certain integral curve in this plane ii another approach is to regard the wavenumber k of the incoming plane wave as held fixed but allow the freedom to adjust b a choice of b g uniquely specifies a hamiltonian for this hamiltonian there will be a definite phase shift now as we take b it is possible to adjust g so that the phase shift does not change if once again we follow an integral curve in the g plane in this interpretation there is a flow between hamiltonians that preserves a long distance observable thus taking b to zero is an equivalent way of reaching a long wavelength approximation binding energy although our discussion of renormalization has been limited to g g g we may also consider g g at least one bound state will be present with ground state energy e one might suspect that de db leads to the same rg equation for g namely equation as the previously studied conditions d c c db and dr db in sections and the appendix our expectation is that this should be true at least in the limit b on general grounds the phase shift is essentially the phase angle of the reflection amplitude r whereas the ground state energy e is the pole of r more generally the s matrix in the complex k plane since r has modulus one it is possible to express it as r s ik s ik where s is some real constant and k the real wavenumber however there is a simple pole at k i s and so e k s requiring that r remain constant as b changes implies that the value of k s remains constant as b is adjusted thus the rg equations are identical the bound state energy for g g is given by solving equation for and k k o expanding to lowest order in both and g g where c g a positive constant that depends only on the value of equation shows once more that e remains invariant as long as the reduced coupling g g scales as b the same scaling found when g was just below g note that as b as long as g g follows this scaling rule a single bound state of arbitrary energy remains this is an example of dimensional transmutation propagator a choice of b g with b and g g g selects a particular hamiltonian hb g from this we will now construct the green s function the position space realization of unitary time evolution however we shall work with pure negative imaginary times gb g x it y x e th y t this imaginary time propagator is the solution to tg x v x g with boundary condition g x it y x y the completeness property of eigenfunctions of hb g means that we are motivated to demonstrate the following two hamiltonians one at scale b and the other at scale b but both with couplings close to g will give equivalent long distance behavior as measured by g at fixed x y bx and fixed t provided that the coupling g is renormalized from b to b according to the scaling laws found in equations and at this point we remember that c c is not the only ratio needed in order to fully specify eigenfunctions we also need and the normalization factor a sup sup this can be fixed by remembering that the set of eigenfunctions e must satisfy orthonormality and closure relations let us focus on the closure property which must hold for any choice of x y and g therefore take x y bx and g so that a sin xe sin ye de x y we recognize here an identity of fourier sine transforms so it is clear that a e this is consistent with dimensional analysis since e should have dimensions of length for g we may write for some dimensionless function b which is strictly positive the propagator may be written as without explicitly evaluating the integral we are interested in proving that gb g is simply related to gb g for b b the simple relation we seek is an equivalence of the two propagators up to an overall scale factor with physical lengths and time held fixed this is a homogeneous transformation with respect to the parameters b and g the existence of such a relation would place a severe constraint on the form of the ratio c c the reason is that the contours in figure show exactly how to preserve the propagator as b however individual points in figure are not representative of a choice of b g rather a given b g corresponds to a horizontal line in the plot all of the uncountably many eigenfunctions of hb g correspond to points on this line under a shrinking of b one can preserve the propagator by following the contour passing through each point to its left we manage on an individual basis to keep all eigenfunctions unchanged if we can adjust g so that each eigenfunction s c c ratio remains the same however there is no guarantee that the new value of the coupling for one energy will coincide with the new coupling required for a different energy more precisely recall that c c is a function of two variables g and write be suppressing x so that c c f g be consider any two distinct energies e and e by changing b to b it is possible to find some g such that and it must be possible to find some g such that these statements are illustrated schematically in figure however gb g gb g requires g g a highly nontrivial condition there is no obvious reason why starting from generic g the renormalized couplings g and g ought to be the same therefore this appears to be an obstruction to finding a simple scaling law for the propagator however it is easy to see that in the vicinity of a fixed point g the nontrivial condition requiring the equivalence of g and g can be satisfied the crux of our argument is this it is only close to a fixed point that f takes the asymptotic form for some real numbers and which may be extracted by studying equation then equations and become g g b b g g and g g b b g g respectively together they imply g g as desired homogeneous transformation laws the scaling relation we seek for the propagator may be obtained from the following two transformation laws an exact one the following equation is exact suppose x y bx and b b for some then in equation make a change of variables eanddiacriticaltilde e within b c c and c a this can be perfectly compensated by a redefinition of the scale factor b since bx e b x eanddiacriticaltilde b x eanddiacriticaltilde since b b the appropriate eigenfunctions are still bessel j one valid only close to a fixed point the following equation is correct only asymptotically close to a fixed point suppose x y bx b and then for upper sign u g g and u u or lower sign u g g and u u proof of upper sign case once again in equation make a change of variables to eanddiacriticaltilde e near a fixed point it is possible to absorb factors of into a redefinition of the reduced coupling rather than a redefinition of b before this is justified by taking the upper limit of integration to be some large but finite value m x for m we shall take m later this means that e is bounded above by m x and hence bm let us choose b m so that is small over the entire integration region so in the small b regime also we replace b g by its limiting value b g assuming it exists thus the constants cst appearing above result from expanding expr around g g they are nonzero by writing u u it is seen that two factors of may be pulled out of the integral although this concludes the proof it is worth explaining it heuristically for g close to g we can set c so that the eigenfunctions are for small x power laws of the form x therefore in the propagator we have two wavefunctions of the form x and y this is how a factor of is obtained a proof for the lower sign case is similar scaling by combining equation with we are able to derive the scaling relation for the propagators evaluated at the same values of x y t but corresponding to different hamiltonians hb g and hb g we shall suppress dependence on the variables x y t which are imagined to be held fixed and instead highlight the dependence of the propagator on the parameters b and g then the upper sign is for g g and the lower sign for g g equation is a central result of this article one can recognize the rg eigenvalues of u found earlier in equations and an equivalent way to state equation is that the propagator satisfies a certain first order pde which is obtained by imagining an infinitesimal change in parameters let for infinitesimal positive expanding to first order in we obtain the physical interpretation of equation is that a change of b in g can be absorbed through a compensating change in u in other words scale dependency may be exchanged for coupling dependency a fact already clear from our derivation of equation notice that the coefficients of the operator u u are precisely the slope of the beta function at the fixed points equation is reminiscent of the callan symanzik equation in quantum field theory which describes how correlation functions change with the renormalization scale at the fixed points we wish to discuss the propagator at the fixed points we have seen that g g corresponds to c only in the limit that b equals taking this limit squeezes the sinusoidal part of the eigenfunction into an infinitesimally narrow region around the origin adapting an integral from we obtain where i is a modified bessel function of the first kind using the well known properties i z ez z for z and i z z for z the asymptotic behavior is given by the fixed point theories both reproduce free particle behavior at short times but have differing power laws at long times close to the fixed points for b g in the vicinity of g but not strictly at those points the functional form of the propagator may be uncovered by rg scaling analysis we illustrate these standard techniques near the uvfp rg for u for u g g but strictly greater than zero g b u g b u iterating n times gives g b u ng b n nu since u is relevant the effective reduced coupling grows under iteration so n cannot be taken arbitrarily large or else the asymptotic approximation breaks down so we stop the iteration at the point where nu u where u is an arbitrary but fixed constant that is sufficiently small solving yields n u u plugging this back in gives g b u u u g b u u u observe that the parametric dependence of g on b and u has simplified to the point where we may now express it as for some function at first sight it might appear that the functional form of depends on the specific value of u indeed we could have imagined the iteration stopping at some u u along the lines of equation we could then write g b u u u b u u for some apparently unrelated function but the important fact is that the left hand side of equation is insensitive to whether the scaling variable halts at u or u this implies an equality z u u u u z and means that the ratio u u and any powers thereof may be absorbed into a redefinition of the scaling variable u thus the form of must be independent of u in other words is truly a function with a single argument in such instance is referred to as a scaling function rg for u for u our n times iterated homogeneous transformation law for the propagator may be written gbxy x n gb nxy x we have reintroduced the spatial variables x and y using dimensional analysis this may be thoroughly justified by redefining the integration variable in equation from e to e t without explicitly evaluating the integral it is easy to see that g t f x bx x t y bx y t for some function f our recursion relation is not sensitive to terms like x t or y t it must be correct only for t x y furthermore the propagator must be symmetric in x and y since one may imagine n being so large that b n xy x is an exceedingly small fixed number it could be so small that xy x recall that x and y are fixed this requires that we choose n logb log which is always possible for a given b and so note that g is a constant including an overall t factor from dimensional analysis we obtain verification fortunately analytical evaluation of g is rather simple for asymptotically large t this allows us to check equations and for large t the integral in equation is dominated by values of e near zero which allows us to replace e xj e x by e x after rescaling the dummy integration variable to extract t we obtain up to an overall constant factor where u g g and c is some constant setting u in equation gives precisely equation it takes a little more effort to show that equation is equivalent to equation when u consider where z z cz of course there is also a similar factor involving y thus the factor u gets squared and becomes u as desired disappearing bound state in this section we set b in the regulator equation and do not allow the well width to vary for clarity we also take x it can always be restored by looking at dimensions for g g the ground state energy scales as e g g as g g this binding energy vanishes at a rate described by the exponent it must also be the case that the probability to find the particle within any finite interval tends to zero the mean position of the particle and all higher moments should run off to infinity in a continuous fashion the rate at which this occurs is given by computing the divergent part of x dx in fact we need only focus on the exponentially falling tail of the wavefunction we find that x dx dx e up to a constant factor the rate of vanishing of e or the degree of divergence of x is controlled by the long distance part of v the specific scheme chosen for the short distance part e g square well has no effect other than to modify the location of the critical value of g this independence of regulator scheme is an example of universality physical systems with very different ultraviolet behavior in this case hamiltonians with very different excited spectra may have similar low energy behavior a nice exercise is to try a regulator like the linear well v gx for x like the square well it has a single dimensionless parameter g responsible for controlling the well slope the same scaling exponent emerges for the ground state energy as in equation but the coefficient c and the location of the fixed point g are not the same as in the square well case one says that is universal but c and g are not it is readily proven that the same exponent results for a generic regulator consider a scheme given by where f is a function defined on with additional properties to be imposed below first we prove that for sufficiently large g the potential binds it is sufficient to show that there exists some and x e with h since this implies that at least one of the discrete eigenvalues of h is negative note that need not be a state of definite energy a convenient choice is xexp x so assume f is integrable a negative expectation value is guaranteed for g e f x x e xdx next we prove that for sufficiently small g there is no bound state recall the fact that the square well regulator equation does not produce binding if g g where g is entirely determined by so take g g f x for all x we assume f is bounded this means that our potential v is everywhere bounded below by the square well the solution to the eigenvalue equation is where g i are the linearly independent solutions to gf x with e suppose that g is large enough to admit at least one bound state so that is a real positive number call the critical value of g needed for this to be true some g by continuity call the left side of equation l g since x are ordinary points of the ode g i and their derivatives are finite when evaluated at x now let us consider how l depends on the parameters expanding in energy we claim that l g equals l g plus a term whose order is no larger than this is because nonanalyticity in the dependence of the solutions to the ode develops when f vanishes for example if f near x then e x x call the right side of equation r expanding in we obtain r o since this o term dominates over the o term obtained by expanding the left side expanding l once more but this time in g around g we get l g o g g finally if g is such that l g r then we have o g g o it follows that g g some classical applications brownian motion brownian motion is a stochastic process which may be regarded as the symmetric random walk in the limit of infinitesimally small time increments in a one dimensional process a real random variable x t varies with a time parameter t the map x t is continuous satisfies an initial condition and may satisfy a final condition as well crucially the process is such that increments in x are independent and identically distributed i e the probability distribution for x t x t is independent of x t for t t but they are identical in the sense that p x t x t a p x t a these distributions are normal with mean zero and variance equal to twice the time interval it is well known how to rigorously assign a probabilistic measure to such a set of real valued continuous functions we are interested in the following conditional expectation value with t n x y and xn x since v is infinite for all x any path that dips into x at any time will be weighted by e this effectively eliminates from consideration all paths that travel left of the origin thus we are considering brownian motion on the half line x see figure kac proved that w satisfies the pde tw x vw with boundary condition limt w x t y x y this is mathematically identical to the problem of finding the quantum mechanical green s function in imaginary time consider v given by equation and let g g according to the quantum result equation for x y bx b and asymptotically large t w x t y t xy b x consider two brownian expectations one for all continuous paths from y to x and another from y to x where all positions are strictly greater than bx then in the large t limit in particular observe that leads to asymptotic equivalence this is rather suprising from the stochastic point of view because the interval where the potential depends on g can be made arbitrarily narrow neverthless it exerts an outsized influence on the sum over paths more precisely consider the set of continuous functions that begin at y and end at x t while always satisfying x for all t sampling only from this space what is the conditional probability that a particle passes through the portal x bx at some intermediate time t there is a finite answer to this question and it can be made arbitrarily small by taking b a naive conclusion might be then that the value of g has little effect on w however the analysis shows the opposite w exhibits very different scaling at two special values of g statistical mechanics of a chain yet another way to interpret the imaginary time green s function is as a classical partition function consider a discrete and finite one dimensional system with n real degrees of freedom x impose fixed boundary conditions x y and xn x on the set of xj define a probability measure by the boltzmann factor exp s z where the energy of a configuration is is a nearest neighbor coupling and v is an external potential we take so that the site to site coupling is attractive it is energetically favorable for x to be similar in value to xj lastly z is a constant chosen to satisfy the normalization condition explicitly a priori there is no relation between n and one is typically interested in evaluating expectations in the measure in the infinite volume limit it is well known that in the double scaling limit n such that n t fixed there is a correspondence between the classical statistical mechanics problem we have just defined and quantum mechanics of a particle propagating in negative imaginary time in fact where the proportionality constant is independent of g the limit we have taken is a continuum limit now we wish to take a thermodynamic limit by making the volume t arbitrarily large in this limit we are interested in extracting the free energy density defined by fxy limt tlogzxy t according to the discussion in section for g g a bound state exists so the dominant behavior of w x t y is exponential in t for large t that is w x t y e e t x y plus exponentially suppressed corrections here e is the ground state energy therefore fxy e terms like log x t vanish in the large t limit so the specific choice of x and y do not affect the free energy density in the thermodynamic limit thus this is finite and so an extensive phase exists if g g however if g g then w x t y is asymptotically a power law in t so the system is no longer extensive in other words we see that the loss of extensivity as the parameter g g is characterized by a universal critical exponent the phase transition described by the crossing of g across g is different from the kind of finite temperature phase transition familiar from lattice models one prominent difference is that in short range lattice spin systems the free energy is extensive on both sides of the critical point nevertheless similar extensive to nonextensive phase transitions are described in for the case these in one experimentally realizable system it is explained how the approach reproduces berezinskii kosterlitz thouless scaling related to a topological transition between winding states of a floppy polymer circling a defect other aspects of the inverse square potential while there are other features and applications of the inverse square potential here we make two brief remarks that extend our analysis and bridge our work with other pedagogical discussions of the inverse square potential three dimensions our results apply to two particles interacting in the s wave via a central potential that is r at large r since the potential is time independent the nontrivial part of the two particle wavefunction is obtained by solving m r v e where m is the reduced mass in a zero orbital angular momentum state u r r it is well known that the radial function u obeys an equation that looks just like the schr dinger equation on the half line md u dr v r u eu r it turns out that the appropriate boundary condition is that u precisely analogous to that of our one dimensional example in a proof is given by demanding that d dr be hermitian with respect to the space obtained from all square integrable linear combinations of functions u satisfying the eigenvalue equation this argument is repeated below let u and u be two such functions the combination of square integrability and satisfaction of the ode implies that u and ui limit to as r goes to then operator hermiticity necessitates that u u u u which is precisely equation again from this we see that u and u are equal up to a multiplicative constant for which the only self consistent choice is thus all ui must equal the same constant c however if c then r which is problematic because r r r yet there is no corresponding delta function in v the only way to avoid this situation is to have c lt while the case has been well studied in the literature see for example it is worth highlighting its rg analysis for its qualitatively different long distance behavior the pure x potential with has a spectrum unbounded from below so one really does need to regulate the hamiltonian with a cutoff in order to obtain a healthy theory suppose this is done with the finite square well equation let ex then for the shallowest bound states satisfying the implicit energy equation is where the phase is determined by the normalizable solution and is not a free parameter this regulator breaks the continuous scale symmetry to a discrete subgroup notice that e leaves equation invariant fix and consider the locus of points in the logb g plane obeying equation if logb g is any such point then a continuous curve of points exist in its vicinity by following the curve to more negative logb g tends toward zero eventually there will come a time when g attains zero but at this point we may jump to another curve and start the flow all over again with a finite value of g this is possible because there are an infinite number of solutions g for a given b the periodicity of tangent means that the coupling g is renormalized but never approaches a limit as b decreases instead each time logb is shifted by g may be identified with its starting value such identification is natural because it keeps g positive the process may be replicated indefinitely b remains strictly positive because it is reduced by a multiplicative factor this describes a rg limit cycle the coupling g cycles through an interval of values
