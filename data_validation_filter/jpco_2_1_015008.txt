rabi resonance in cs atoms and its application to microwave magnetic field measurement we have recently presented a technique for measuring unknown microwave mw fields based on rabi resonances induced by the interaction of atoms with a phase modulated mw field the single peak feature of the measurement model makes the technique a valuable tool for simple and fast field measurement here we demonstrated a detailed investigation of rabi resonance of cs atoms inside a vapour cell for illustration we used the rabi resonance based field detection technique to determine the field strength inside an x band cavity for applied power in the range of to dbm the difference between the practical measurement and the simulation was approximately about for an applied power of dbm and a higher accuracy could be expected for a larger power input introduction to recently atom based microwave mw measurement has also inspired great interest because of its potential ability to link the mw quantities with si units as a result relying on various physical principles many atom based mw sensors have been developed such as the mw power standard mw electrometry mw electric magnetic field imaging and mw magnetometers as compared to traditional measurement atom based measurement is intrinsically calibrated where field strength is translated into rabi frequency via well known atomic constants particularly the use of an atomic vapour cell serves as sensing head making atom based measurements properly for practical applications additionally a non conducting dielectric cell containing atomic samples reduces the field perturbation compared with the metal sensing head used in traditional probes for these reasons atom based measurement provides the possibility of detecting mw fields with higher accuracy in our previous work as a proof of principle demonstration we presented an approach for continuously frequency tunable mw magnetic field detection using atomic rabi resonances of different hyperfine transitions here we demonstrate a detailed investigation of rabi resonance and its application to mw field measurement in our technique a phase modulated field drives atomic rabi resonance which is a function of the modulation frequency m and reaches its peak when m by scanning m for a given input power we can obtain the resonance lineshape then is determined by fitting the measured data to the theoretical model of field measurement developed here for the magnetic dipole transition bb where b is the bohr magneton h where h is planck s constant and b represents the mw magnetic field strength which is parallel to quantization axis of the zeeman sublevels in this case for illustration we performed a series of experiments with our previously proposed atom based field detection technique to measure a certain range of mw power at approximately ghz using our cavity based cs rabi resonances experimental setup the agreement of the experimental results and theoretical calculations proves our technique is simple and effective we note that the measurement of mw magnetic fields inside the cavity cell physical system plays an important role in the development of high performance vapour cell based atomic clocks there have already been different approaches to this application mw field strength was measured in an rb clock cavity via adiabatic rapid passage a mw magnetic field distribution was imaged with rabi oscillations inside a microfabricated rb vapour cell the technique here provides an alternate direct means for accurate measurement of magnetic field strength inside a cell in gas field measurement model the rabi resonances were observed first by cappeller and mueller in and then intensely studied by camparo et al including the and rabi resonances the basic principle of rabi resonances theory is mentioned here more details on the theory are available in when two level atoms interact with a phase modulated mw field i e and x m mcos mt where m is the modulation index the probability of finding the atoms in the excited state oscillates at the modulation frequency m and m the oscillation behaviour can be well described with two experimentally distinguished oscillation amplitudes i e p and p the amplitudes of p and p are resonant functions of and m and exhibit resonant enhancements when m and m these resonant enhancements of oscillation amplitudes are termed the rabi resonance and the rabi resonance respectively under the small signal approximation the amplitudes of p and p can be derived from a calculation based on the density matrix equations see equation where and are the longitudinal and transverse relaxation rate respectively is the average mw field atom detuning tan m m and tan m m writing p t p sin mt and p t p cos mt we could then obtain the amplitudes p and p which are detectable signals in experiments observing equation we note that the rabi resonances have two significant features i the rabi resonance reaches its minimum when the mw atom detuning vanishes i e p when meaning the rabi resonance could be used to estimate the atomic transition frequency and ii the rabi resonance reaches its maximum when the modulation frequency is one half of the rabi frequency i e p peaks when m indicating its potential for measuring the rabi frequency with this highly useful feature several rabi resonance based applications e g the strength stabilization of the mw field and or laser field so called atomic candle measurements of material properties e g the absorption refractive index observations of cavity mode stability for rb atomic clocks and generation of the mw power standard have been proposed and or demonstrated experimentally it is noteworthy that what these applications have in common is that the rabi resonance amplitude p is considered a function of rabi frequency where the modulation frequency m is fixed during operation as a result only a specific field that corresponds to a known modulation frequency can be detected or stabilized in these cases for the mw magnetometer demonstrated here we rewrote the rabi resonance into a function of modulation frequency and used it to measure an unknown magnetic field strength according to equation b m can be considered constant under the fixed experiment settings including laser and mw levels thus the amplitude of the resonance has the following simple expression from equation the amplitude of the oscillating function p exhibits resonance when m with a peak amplitude of to measure an unknown we first experimentally measure the resonance lineshape by scanning m and then i e field strength can be determined by fitting the theoretical model obtained previously to the measured lineshape similar to the q definition for the atomic candle we let q fwhm for the field measurement model equation where fwhm is the full width at half maximum fwhm knowing that the resonance peak occurs at m with an amplitude of we set p fwhm then according to equation fwhm can be computed as thus the line q has the potential to be narrowed greatly by decreasing the longitudinal relaxation rate before measuring the rabi frequency with the rabi resonance we need to determine the atomic transition frequency precisely because the rabi frequency is also a function of the detuning from the resonance here we use the rabi resonance to determine the transition frequency for this purpose we rewrite the rabi resonance into a function of frequency detuning for given experimental settings and use it to measure an unknown atomic frequency with a peak amplitude of then fwhm of the rabi resonance can be computed as briefly in this work we detailed a rabi resonance based mw magnetometer and demonstrated its use in cavity field detection this is completed via the two main steps i e we first use dr spectra and the rabi resonance equation to determine the mw atom interaction frequency and then measure the mw magnetic field strength inside the cavity via equation experiments our experimental setup is shown in figure a we used a cs vapour cell to perform rabi resonances between atomic hyperfine states f mf f mf figure b shows the energy levels of cs in a static magnetic field h a linearly polarized laser was used to pump and detect the cs atoms whose frequency was stabilized to saturated absorption resonances on the d line for all measurements demonstrated here a laser power of w corresponding to density of wcm was used using braided windings wrapped around the cavity the temperature of the vapour cell filled with pure cs and torr n was heated and stabilized at c the whole physical package was centrally mounted inside three dimensional helmholtz coils we note that the detection of rabi resonances allows only for determination of the local rabi frequency and hence the local mw field strength therefore uniform field distribution is needed for the determination of unique rabi frequency to the inside dimensions of the rectangular cavity were mm mm mm which allowed for the te mode operating near ghz the advantage of this scheme is that the mw magnetic field was approximately uniform over the entire interaction region in the atomic samples to demonstrate this advantage we simulated the magnetic field inside the cavity to show how the fields remain uniform in the centre of the cavity as shown in figure c mw couplings were created with two small holes with a diameter of mm the two waveguide to coaxial adapters were connected to the cavity after passing through the first adapter the input mw was irradiated into the cavity via a coupling hole to drive rabi resonances in a thermal cs atomic vapour the output port of the cavity was connected to the second adapter which was terminated by a ohm matched load two cutoff waveguides were attached to the cavity walls with the purpose of suppressing mw leakage and field perturbation during operation through the cutoff waveguides the laser illuminated the cell perpendicular to the direction of the applied mw magnetic field transmission of the laser through the vapour was monitored with a cm sup sup si photodiode and then finally recorded with an fft analyser to valiwe assumed here a static magnetic field of h mg in the x direction also in this direction was the mw magnetic field under these conditions the seven mf magnetic dipole transitions were observed as frequency was scanned and these dr spectra were recorded via the transmission light through the cell as illustrated in figure d results prior to the excitation by the modulated field we carry out the typical dr operation see figure d and use the obtained dr spectra to estimate the transition frequency after that we connect the pd output to an fft spectra analyser and turn on the phase modulation function of the mw signal source finally we tune the applied mw frequency finely around the obtained estimation atomic frequency via dr spectra until p while keeping p during the tuning process figure shows examples of p and p resonating at khz and khz respectively with different applied mw frequencies where a khz phase modulation signal is applied to the mw field specifically figure a shows the on resonance state p when on which the oscillation amplitude depends only on the rabi resonance from figures b and c which represent the near resonance cases we find that a slight frequency detuning could also induce mw atoms interaction as expected no field atoms interaction occurs at mw frequencies far from resonance see figure d obviously the atomic transition frequency is slightly shifted from ghz due to the presence of n thus the mw frequency which is required for mw atom interaction is precisely confirmed through the procedures described previously next to valias an illustrative example figure presents a comparison of theoretical and experimentally measured lineshapes of the rabi resonances at two different power levels the experimental data were obtained by measuring p oscillations occurring at m on the fft spectra analyser as a function of m the solid curves in this figure represent the theoretical fit to the experimental data using equation their peaks yield information about the rabi frequencies as can be seen in figure the measured data closely follow the theoretical curves for completeness and quantitative understanding of our method figure presents the power dependent rabi resonance signals as a function of modulation frequency at six different power levels p dbm dbm dbm dbm dbm and dbm without normalizing the resonance amplitudes which correspond to rabi frequencies of khz khz khz khz khz and khz respectively from figure we find that for every db increase in p the rabi frequency approximately doubles this relationship is valid especially for a relatively large power input it is worth noting that the validity of the small signal assumption gradually weakens as the applied power decreases and this causes the decline of measurement accuracy despite this our method still exhibits a reasonable approximation additionally signal amplitude varies rapidly with the variation of applied power however of greatest concern is the frequency corresponding to the resonance peak rather than the amplitude in these measurements this a major advantage of atom based measurement clearly the rabi resonance lineshape has a unique peak at m for any given as predicted by equation following the technique described previously we repeated the measurements while varying the incident power level p in the range from dbm w to dbm mw we then plotted the rabi frequencies as a function of power and fit the linear function of our measurements as shown in figure because the magnetic field sensed by atoms is proportional to the square root of the incident mw power p in the case of the cavity structure the measured rabi frequency exhibits a linear relationship with the square root of the incident mw power as one would expect comparison and discussion to further verify the validity of this measurement technique we used hfss finite element simulation tool to calculate the field strength inside the interaction region and compared it to the measured results it is challenging to determine the wall thickness and the dielectric characteristic of the vapour cell accurately because of manufacturing limitations in our simulation we adjusted the two parameters slightly to match real measurement conditions which mainly included the measurement frequency and cavity resonant frequency this is particularly important for accurate simulation because field distribution is frequency dependent according to the cavity response figure shows the simulated mw magnetic field along three directions of the cavity with a power injection of dbm indicating that the field distribution is quite uniform over the entire interaction region i e mm x z mm and mm y mm where the centre of the cell is defined as the origin of coordinates a field variation of only is observed in the y direction but there is almost no variation in the x and z directions because of the narrow laser diameter mm a significant field perturbation due to the presence of the cell and optical holes is observed figure also indicates how to determine the simulated field figure shows a comparison between the simulation results and those obtained from the practical measurements at different power levels where the experimental values were calculated from the rabi frequencies shown in figure from figure similar linear behaviours are observed from both methods as expected and it is clear that our setup served as a field power sensor in these measurements the difference between the practical measurement and the simulation is approximately for an applied power of dbm and a higher accuracy could be expected for a larger power input note that no attempt has been made to optimize this setup to obtain the ultimate ability to detect mw field clearly this ability can be easily extended to cover not only the broader scope of under test field power but also other frequency bands by using different atomic species and or energy level transitions especially for the use of magnetic sensitive hyperfine transition it is worth noting that the technique discussed here demonstrates how to measure unknown field strength inside a mw cavity via rabi resonances furthermore this technique is also available for near far field cases we note also that a mw magnetic field can be measured by means of rabi oscillations rabi oscillations present a multi peak feature in measurement in which the rabi frequency for a given power level is determined by fitting the data to a cosine function however the demonstrated field detection technique here based on the rabi resonance presents a single peak feature making it easy to perform field measurements similar to the field detection based on the rabi oscillations our technique also allows frequency tuneable field detection by adjusting the applied static magnetic field additionally we performed this experiment with cs because of the many practical requirements for mw measurements often occurring in x band to the best of our knowledge this is the first time that rabi resonances have been used to measure unknown field strength inside a cavity conclusions in summary we demonstrated a technique for measuring any unknown mw magnetic field via atomic dynamic rabi resonances to detail the rabi resonance based detection technique we performed a demonstrating experiment and we compared the power levels measured from the experiments to those computed from the simulations both results show that in principle rabi resonance can be used to measure field strength finally we emphasize that the rabi resonances technique because of its simplicity and single peak character may offer a highly useful technique to measure mw field strength over a broad dynamic range using this atom based si traceable measurement technique under test mw power can be linked directly to the modulation frequency which could be referenced to a primary frequency standard
