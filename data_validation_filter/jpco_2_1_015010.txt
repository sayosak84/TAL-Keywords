alteration of tunneling mechanism due to ferromagnetic insulator on andreev spectroscopy for ferromagnet superconductor junctions we have theoretically elucion this peak splitting of the tunneling conductance we have found that the exchange potential in the insulator gives crucial changes to the tunneling conductance through the coherence factor in superconductor the peak splitting exists even though ferromagnetic metal is replaced by normal metal moreover in such junctions the magnetization in ferromagnetic metal gives asymmetric tunneling conductance spectra between electron and hole injections we have also clarified the difference of resultant influences of ferromagnetic insulator on tunneling conductance between spin band asymmetry ferromagnet and standard stoner ferromagnet junctions introduction tunneling spectroscopy gives us many insights of the electronic properties of metals and superconductors for instance the symmetry of superconducting pair potential has been reflected sensitively on the differential conductance spectra in normal metal unconventional superconductor junctions the junctions including magnetically active interface has also been an important subject from the view point of fundamental physics as well as from an application perspective on both the magnetism and the superconductivity in materials especially ferromagnetic metal superconductor fm junction has attracted much attention on investigations of the proximity effect the transport phenomena and so on for example in the fm junctions the andreev reflection ar is suppressed by the exchange potential in fm indeed this modulation of ar has been utilized to measure the polarization of fm in the fm point contacts furthermore as one of the interesting magnetic effects there is spin active interface by the ferromagnetic insulator fi it has been shown theoretically that the double conductance peak around bias voltage corresponding to the superconducting energy gap in semiconductor junction appears due to the spin flip scattering in the fm fi wave fm fi junction it has been revealed that splitting of zero bias conductance peak zbcp occurs by the spin filtering effect of fi additionally the spin filtering effect of fi can give electron refrigeration in the fi wave superconductor fi junctions in these theoretical investigations of fm junctions ferromagnetic metals have been described by the stoner model referred to as stf below however stf has not totally covered itinerant electron ferromagnetism in real materials on the other hand there is the ferromagnetism kinetically driven by spin dependent bandwidth asymmetry or equivalently by an effective mass splitting between and spin particles we also consider this spin dependent bandwidth asymmetry ferromagnet sbaf as well as stf to obtain more general results than the case of stf only for sbaf junction some results similar to stf case have been obtained however the effect of fi in sbaf fi junctions have not been studied yet accordingly the study of the effect of fi on the tunneling conductance in sbaf fi junctions becomes important to clarify the difference with those in stf fi junctions in this paper we apply our previous formula based on the blonder thinkham klapwijk theory to the fm fi wave and wave superconductor junctions in which the polarization of fm can be hybridized between stf and sbaf we show significant role of the exchange potential in fi on the tunneling conductance it is found that the fi gives specific difference in tunneling conductance between sbaf fi and stf fi junctions furthermore we study in detail how the exchange potential in fi generates the spin filtering effect as result term leading the spin filtering effect that have not been discussed so far will be presented and we also investigate the effect of fi on tunneling conductance when the superconducting pair potential is breaking time reversal symmetry model and formulation in the present paper we employ two dimensional ballistic fm fi junction see figure with semi infinite electrodes as in our previous paper the interface located at is described by vex where and are the function non magnetic and ferromagnetic barrier potentials respectively here or is spin index and for spin the bogoliubov de gnnes bdg equation describing the system is given by where here and are the wave functions for electronlike and holelike quasiparticles elq and hlq with the eigenvalue respectively and is the single particle hamiltonian in the ferromagnet side the single particle hamiltonian is given by uex efm where is the effective mass for spin band particle is the exchange potential and is the fermi energy here we assume hybrid ferromagnet between sbaf and stf for fm the pure sbaf and stf can be described by for uex and uex ef for respectively the magnetization of the ferromagnet is given by where the polarization for spin is expressed as the in the superconductor side is given by ms efs where and are the effective mass of the quasiparticle and the fermi energy respectively in this paper we treat singlet superconductors and the spatial dependence of the pair potential is simply taken as where is the heaviside step function in the following we apply the quasiclassical approximation where in this approximation the pair potential can be described by for wave and cos for wave superconductors where is the angle between the direction of trajectory of quasiparticles in the superconductor and the interface normal is the angle between the interface normal and the crystalline axis of superconductor moreover for the wave vectors in the ferromagnets and kelq hlq ks in the superconductors we consider situation where ks and ms ms with ms to describe the fermi surface difference between and spin bands we assume efm efs ef and from the momentum conservation on the direction parallel to the interface we have sin sin kssin where is incident angle of spin particles in fm see figure in addition the bdg equation can be reduced to the effective one dimensional equation due to the translational invariance along the interface of the hamiltonian for spin electron injection with angle to the interface normal there are four scattering trajectories ar with angle ar normal reflection nr transmission to superconductor as elq and transmission as hlq see figure for these scattering processes the probability coefficients and for ar and nr are obtained under appropriate boundary conditions for the bdg wave functions at as with where and the barrier parameters is defined as the angle resolved conductance gs for spin at zero temperature can be calculated by using ar and nr coefficients as where vf is the group velocity of the spin particle in fm setting in gs we can obtain the conductance gn when the superconductor is in the normal state following our previous paper the normalized conductance for spin is defined as where is the bias voltage the normalized conductance is given by gt ev gt in the calculation we should take into account the critical angle for injected particles as sin cos results differential conductance we begin with the dependence of the normalized conductance gt ev in fm fi junctions for zex under the fixed value of magnetization figure shows gt ev for some combinations giving when is the wave superconductor fm fi junction all gt ev show the double peak around ev which is asymmetric with respect to ev the height of the double peak decreases for the change from the pure sbaf to the pure stf it is noted that the double peak is different from those indicated by zutic and sarma since any spin flip scattering processes are not considered in our model thus the double peak will be owing to the spin filtering effects of fi in figure we show gt ev in fm fi junction for for pure stf the results by kashiwaya et al have been reproduced for figure gt ev shows the double peak around ev similar to those in wave superconductor case for and figures and the asymmetric splitting of zbcp has been obtained as in the case of wave superconductor the height of peaks decreases as fm approaches pure stf from these results we can notice for both and wave cases that sbaf gives relatively larger double peaks than those in stf as shown in our previous paper the height of the peak can be attribute to the difference in the critical angle between sbaf and stf to see the constitution of the splitting peak in the tunneling conductance each spin components of the conductance and are shown in figure with gt ev in the case of sbaf stf mixed fm for the junction including wave superconductor figure since the conductance peak at ev is suppressed as result it can be seen for ev that behaves like shifting to the negative ev in contrast to shifting to the positive ev additionally the double peak in gt ev around ev is comprised while that around ev is comprised by both of and for the wave superconductor figure and are shifted to the negative ev and to the positive ev respectively then the resulting zbcp is asymmetrically suppressed as will be described below these behaviors of the tunneling conductance can be interpreted by the impact of fi on the andreev and nr coefficients effect of fi in this subsection to see and to emphasize more clearly the effect of fi we treat mainly fi junctions by setting parameters as and ms we show the dependence of gt ev for in figure for fi junction figure the conductance peak at ev is decreasing with increasing the double peak clearly appearing at zex is also suppressed following the increment of and vanishes when zex for fi junction the former results of are reproduced the zbcp splits for all except zex and vanishes at zex figure as it can be found directly in figure gt ev is symmetric with respect to ev for both wave and wave cases thus asymmetric behavior of gt ev as shown in figures can be attributed to the magnetization in fm the dependence of gt ev for in fm fi junctions are plotted for wave figure and wave figure cases for wave case gt ev shows asymmetric behavior figures however as approaches the asymmetric behavior of gt ev is weakened with suppression of peak around ev as result the difference between sbaf and stf will be difficult to identify when is close to for wave cases figure it is also clear that the asymmetric splitting of zbcp is due to the influence of in contrast to wave cases asymmetric splitting of zbcp is kept except zex although the height of peaks is suppressed as increases the magnitude of peaks in sbaf case is larger than that in stf case in order to clarify the origin of the double peak as result of direct influence of the we show the andreev and nr coefficients because the conductance consists of these coefficients within the btk model it is found in figure that the behavior of the coefficients for and spin particles are inverted with respect to ev for ev the mechanism of this inversion can be explained naturally from the viewpoint of symmetry between electron and hole bounded by ar that is the injection of electron with spin for ev corresponds to that of hole with spin for ev and vice versa for example in the situation the probability of ar for spin electron injection is higher than that of spin electron injection even though the ar is suppressed by for ev in contrast to the probability of nr for spin electron is higher than that of spin electron injection on the other hand as mentioned above and for ev correspond to spin and spin holes injection respectively therefore for ev the probability of ar for spin electron is lower than that for spin electron this inverted behavior is also applicable to the case of nr coefficients because the density of probability flow is preserved vf vf consequently for ev has peak at ev in the case of wave superconductor as shown in figure since ar is depressed by is seemed shifting to the negative positive ev on the other hand for ev shows symmetric behavior with respect to ev there is however slight difference between and due to equation nevertheless this difference of the for ev does not appear in gt ev since the conservation of the probability density flow is satisfied these obtained results indicate that the split of the conductance peak has not been straightforward shift in bias voltage we can approach to the origin of the split of the conductance peak figures by analyzing the denominator of the conductance subtracting the denominators between gs and gs we have the term equation gs and gs have half of this term with mutually opposite sign in their denominator respectively see appendix thus we can conclude that leads the spin filtering effect therefore it is notable that the balance between reflections for spin and spin particle injections is broken when conversely the spin filtering effect dose not occur for it is obvious from equation that becomes for zex and zex it goes without saying about zex however for zex an interesting reflection process takes place at the interface in this case nr occurs for spin electrons in spite of similarly to that for spin electrons owing to the reason for this nr is that the ar holes with spin caused by spin electrons completely transmitted interface are converted to the ar electrons with spin again after being reflected by the probabilities of nr for both spin and spin electrons injections have the same weight because these nr are arisen from it is also noted that becomes real number in ev as result becomes for zex since when is real number reflection processes for zex is depicted when spin electrons with ev are injected from to the interface in figure in addition to the usual nr in figure by there is the nr in figure through ar by as explained above from the above discussion we define and res to quantitatively describe the effect of as in order to simply grab the energy dependence of and res we integrated cos on the angle from to in equation the ev dependence of res and for gs are shown in figure for the wave case since has minimum value at certain ev nearly the resulting has the conductance peak at ev figure on the other hand for gs since has opposite sign has the peak at ev the ev dependence of and shown in figure can be understood with same reason because the denominator is common among and gs for wave case we show the results for the sign of res is reversed with comparing to wave case as shown in figure thus has minimum value at certain ev the resulting conductance peak of emerges at certain negative ev nearly in contrast to this the peak of is at certain positive ev close to figure because has opposite sign from these obtained results it can be interpreted that the spin filtering effect is due to the imaginary part of the coherence factor induced by additionally for the emergence of the splitting of the conductance peak for both and wave superconductors it seems that there is optimal combination of and indeed it can be easily found that zex zex has minimum value at zex for example as shown in figure it is found that the splitting peak is sharper when close to it will be an interesting problem to compare the splitting of zbcp by the broken time reversal symmetry btrs state with those by for the btrs we choose cos btrs for the dx is wave or cos btrssin for the dx idxy wave symmetry here we ignore the effect of fi on btrs pairing state for simplicity in the dx is wave case the width on ev of the splitting peak position depends on the magnitude of btrs since the difference in the splitting of zbcp between btrs and cases is obviously on broad peak to peak width we set here btrs and also calculate for to investigate changes on zbcp in these cases since dx wave pair potential is dominant the angle averaged for both cases show almost similar behavior as in the case of fi dx wave junction see figures and this means that the spin and spin components of gt ev shift in opposite directions on ev by the change of the minimum value of owing to therefore as shown in figure the double peak structure of gt ev originated from the imaginary wave component collapses with increasing on the other hand as shown in figure gt ev in fi dx idxy wave junction behaves similarly to that in fi dx wave junction since the zero energy andreev bound state exists the structures of gt ev around ev for both cases consists of superimposition of shifted peaks of gt and gt see inset at the upper right in figures and gt ev around ev will be useful not only to investigate the difference between btrs and in the origin of zbcp splitting but also to distinguish between btrs pair potentials in figure we show the dependence of gt ev in fm fi dx is wave junctions we can see that the height of splitting peak due to the btrs is suppressed with change from pure sbaf to pure stf with the increase of it can be seen for all fm cases that the position of splitting peak is shifted to negative ev direction and the structure of peak is broken with the suppression of height for dx idxy wave state see figure gt ev shows the almost similar behavior as that in dx wave case from obtained results in these cases it becomes difficult to identify the btrs for zex because the behavior of gt ev is similar to those in fm fi dx wave junctions shown in figure and figure however for zex the height of double peak may provide an useful information on the difference between sbaf and stf conclusion in this paper we have studied the tunneling conductance in two dimensional ballistic ferromagnet metal fi superconductor fm fi junctions for both wave and wave superconductor cases it has been unveiled that the ferromagnetic barrier potential has given rise to split of the conductance peak reflecting ar bound states it is also found that the height of the conductance peak becomes larger with increasing the magnitude of for sbaf fi junction in contrary to those for stf fi junction from these obtained results we can speculate that differences between stf and sbaf may be more clearly observed in the tunneling conductance for junctions including fi rather than non magnetic insulator case furthermore as most important result it has been clarified that the exchange potential in fi induces the imaginary part of superconducting coherence factor as cause of conductance peak splitting the resulting symmetrical splitting peak are made asymmetric by the magnetization of fm it is scenario of asymmetric splitting peak in fm fi junction in accordance with this scenario we have investigated the double peak structure in junction including the dx is wave or dx idxy wave superconductor although it is an example of specific magnitude of subdominant paring potential the tunneling conductance in junctions including the btrs is also effective for discriminating between sbaf and stf in this study we have never considered other magnetic effects such as spin mixing effects and proximity effects inclusion of these effects would be necessary for realistic theory and be an important future problems
