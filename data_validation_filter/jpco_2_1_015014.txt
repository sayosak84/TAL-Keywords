a two particle simulation of nonunitary newtonian gravity the result of a numerical simulation of two interacting particles in the framework of nonunitary newtonian gravity is presented here particles are held close together by a d harmonic trap and interact with each other via an electrical delta like potential and via the ordinary newtonian term together with a fluctuational nonunitary counterpart of the latter fundamental nonunitarity can be seen as arising from the interaction of the physical degrees of freedom with gravitational hidden copies of them starting from an energy eigenstate within the ordinary setting it is shown that while energy expectation remains constant a slow net variation of the von neumann entropy for the system as a whole takes place with a small modulation induced on the relative entanglement entropy of the two particles besides the simulation shows explicitly how fundamental gravity induced entropy can be clearly distinguished from the subjective notion of coarse grained entropy i e from the entropy of one particle with respect to the environment of the other introduction the possible role of gravity in producing a fundamental nonunitary time evolution of the state vector in quantum mechanics qm has been invoked in the past few decades by a number of the long standing difficulties posed by the two basic processes of qm i e the schr dinger deterministic evolution and the nonunitary process associated with the act of measurement lead to the quest of how to reconcile these radically different processes and explain the transition to classicality it is worth noting that the origin of the quantum to classical transition is today widely investigated and the emergence of classicality has been attributed mainly to environmental decoherence a different route to a gravity related decoherence has been also proposed which is entirely due to the presence of relativistic time dilation whose effect on a composite quantum particle is to induce a universal coupling between the center of mass and its internal degrees of freedom the resulting decoherence of the particle s position takes place even for isolated composite systems and does not involve any modification of qm the important point here is that in both the frameworks environmental and time dilation decoherence global unitarity is preserved and some fundamental problems at least in our view remain within this context in the past years de filippo introduced a nonunitary non markovian model of newtonian gravity nng from now on see e g references therein on the one hand this model can be seen as the non relativistic limit of a classically stable version of higher derivative gravity whose heuristic application to black hole singularity is in agreement with bekenstein hawking entropy given the smoothed singularity of the black hole see section vi of on the other hand it presents several appealing features to become a natural candifor example while reproducing at a macroscopic level the ordinary newtonian interaction it presents a mass threshold for localization which for ordinary matter densities is about sup sup proton masses as a key result it provides a mechanism for the evolution of macroscopic coherent superpositions of states into ensembles of pure states furthermore the evolution of the density matrix is compatible with the expectations leading to the phenomenological spontaneous localization models as it was argued that they should be both nonlinear and nonunitary however at variance with them it does not present obstructions consistent with its special relativistic extension as to the non markovian character of the model it is interesting to mention the works of unruh who studied some nonunitary toy models mimicking black hole evaporation pointing out the quest for non markovianity in order to avoid net dissipation while keeping decoherence in the nng model such a feature is built in together with a number of other appealing properties like the natural relativistic extension on the black hole entropy side in the last decades it has been shown how the decoherence associated to black hole formation and evaporation appears to be a fundamental one requiring a modification of the unitary time evolution of qm in a nonunitary sense that would allow a non vanishing probability for the evolution from pure states to mixed states in this sense black hole entropy has been hypothesized as due to the entanglement between matter fields inside and outside the event horizon the ultimate meaning of the degrees of freedom involved in its definition remaining quite elusive likewise starting from suitable initial conditions only a nonunitary quantum dynamics could allow for a microscopic derivation of the second law of thermodynamics for a closed system by resorting to the concept of von neumann entropy as pointed out in in this way it should be possible in principle to shed new light on the long standing and still open problem of quantum foundations of the second law of thermodynamics without resorting to the ambiguous and subjective procedure of coarse graining indeed deep contradictions arise when dealing with the problem of the physical nature and origin of the law of increasing entropy in a closed system as pointed out by landau and lifshitz in particular difficulties show up when one tries to apply statistical physics to the entire universe taken as a single closed system a solution could be found by resorting to the general theory of relativity in which the universe as a whole must be regarded as a system in a variable gravitational field but within such a context the application of the law of increase of entropy does not imply relaxation of statistical equilibrium furthermore another problem in formulating the law of increasing entropy arises when defining the direction of time as that of increasing entropy this should be valid also in qm but qm involves a physical non equivalence of the two directions of time when considering the interaction of a quantum object with a classical one i e the measurement process aim of this work is to make a first step in demonstrating the ability of nng to reproduce a gravity induced relaxation towards thermodynamic equilibrium even for a perfectly isolated system to do so a simple system of two interacting particles is considered while of course localization mechanism is not acting in this case due to the far from threshold mass of the particles some of the peculiar characteristic of the model can be verified in a more general context with respect to the single lump problem more specifically we consider the two particles in a harmonic trap interacting with each other through electrostatic and gravitational interaction starting from an eigenstate of the physical hamiltonian we carry out a numerical simulation and calculate the time evolution of the von neumann entropy incidentally this entropy can be interpreted as an entanglement entropy with some fictitious hidden degrees of freedom which recalls the mentioned approach to black hole entropy as entanglement entropy as a result we find that entropy fluctuations take place owing to the nonunitary part of gravitational interactions with the initial pure state evolving into a mixture this constitutes a first necessary step an extension of this work can be envisaged which could show explicitly within a realistic setting the way in which thermodynamics could emerge in the framework of nng shedding new light on the possible role of gravity in the quantum foundations of thermodynamics in ordinary low energy physics the plan of the paper is as follows in section we give a brief general description of the basic nng model in section we introduce the specific model which is the subject of our study and set the parameter values section is then devoted to the application of nng model to the two particles system via numerical simulations and contains the main results of the paper finally in section we draw some conclusions and outline future perspectives of this work explicit expressions of the energy matrix elements are contained in the appendix a brief survey on nonunitary newtonian gravity the aim of this section is to briefly recall the key features of the nng model on the basis of a number of considerations among which the consistency with the basic formal relations of qm energy conservation classical and quantum behavior of matter suggestion that non unitary terms could have a gravitational origin it is possible to isolate a two parameter class of non unitary gravity models as discussed in detail in we will comment later in the section on these parameters let us start here by giving a definition of the model in its simplest form suitably oriented to the problem we are going to discuss below let and x e be the non relativistic physical hamiltonian of a finite number of particle species like electrons nuclei ions atoms and or molecules where denote the whole set j x j x of creation annihilation operators i e one couple per particle species and spin component and x e includes the usual electromagnetic interactions accounted for in atomic molecular and condensed matter physics denoting by h the physical energy operator including also the usual newtonian interaction to incorporate that part of gravitational interactions responsible for non unitarity one has to introduce complementary creation annihilation operators and x j x and x j x and the overall meta hamiltonian the above operators act on the product f f and x of fock spaces of the and and x operators where m is the mass of the i th particle species and g is the gravitational constant the and x operators obey the same statistics as the corresponding operators while and x and x the meta particle state space s is the subspace of f f and x including the meta states obtained from the vacuum and x by applying operators built in terms of the products j x and x j y and symmetrical with respect to the interchange andleftrightarrow and x as a consequence they have the same number of physical and and x hidden meta particles of each species since constrained meta states cannot distinguish between physical and hidden operators the observable algebra is identified with the physical operator algebra in view of this expectation values can be evaluated by preliminarily tracing out the and x operators in particular the most general meta state corresponding to one particle states is represented by with this is a consistent definition since and x e tot generates a group of unitary endomorphisms of s if we prepare a pure n particle state represented in the original setting excluding gravitational interactions by its representation in s is given by the meta state it should be stressed that the model could be formulated through an hubbard stratonovich transformation without any explicit reference to the hidden degrees of freedom as a dynamic equation for the density matrix of the observed degrees of freedom note that and x e tot and and x e ph and x e ph anddiacriticaltilde anddiacriticaltilde differ only due to correlations in fact because of the state constraint the hidden degrees of freedom show the same average energy of the observed ones while the two last sums in and x e tot have approximately equal expectation values and fluctuate around the classical gravitational energy while these energy fluctuations have to be present in any model leading to dynamical wave function localization which in itself requires a certain injection of energy on the other side the same fluctuations though irrelevant on a macroscopic scale are precisely what can lead to thermodynamic equilibrium in a closed system if thermodynamic entropy is identified with von neumann entropy indeed due to the interaction with the hidden degrees of freedom a pure eigenstate of the ordinary energy and x e ph is expected to evolve into a mixture it is just this feature inferred on the above general grounds that we will check numerically on a specific simple physical system a further comment is in order within a more general version of the model we have n interacting identical copies of the system under study indeed such a symmetry requirement which has to be imposed as a constraint on meta states is mandatory in order to avoid a priori a net energy flux between observable and hidden degrees of freedom and to guarantee energy conservation that happens in strict analogy with the nonunitary toy model introduced by unruh and wald and the simple quantum mechanical model recently analyzed by unruh which takes into account the scattering of two particles off each other mediated by some hidden degrees of freedom represented as a certain number of spin objects it is also interesting to note that the limit n reproduces the famous nonlinear newton schr dinger equation sometimes considered in the literature as a possible candithe physical system interacting particles in a trap in this section we introduce the system model that will be the subject of our study in the following then we look for a range of physical parameters where the two body interaction term in the hamiltonian can be considered at most comparable with the kinetic and harmonic terms let us start by considering a single particle of mass confined by a spherically symmetric harmonic trap the complete wave functions are where r rnl anl e l f n l with anl the normalization factor and f the confluent hypergeometric function and ylm are the spherical harmonics the corresponding energy levels are let us now introduce a system of n interacting particles in the same spherical trap whose physical hamiltonian in the ordinary first quantization setting is here is the mass of the particles is the frequency of the trap and l is the s wave scattering length we are considering a dilute system such that the electrical interaction can be assumed to have a contact form with a dominant s wave scattering channel we take numerical parameters that make the electrical interaction at most comparable with the oscillator s energy while gravity enters the problem as an higher order correction reliable values of the parameters could be estimated such that the condition holds where u is the mean value of the delta interaction potential evaluated on the system s initial state furthermore if we assume that only the first levels above the ground are excited then u can be evaluated approximately on the th order ground state in our case then from now on we fix n in equation which corresponds to the simplest case of two interacting particles in the following section we apply nng model to this system and study its time evolution starting from an initial pure state particularly from an energy eigenstate for simplicity we perform our computation within a reduced hilbert space built on the lowest energy eigenvalues of the system corresponding to the tensor product of the single particle space spanned by the first states i e the ground state and three degenerate excited states of the harmonic oscillator the consistency of this huge dimensionality reduction is verified a posteriori by the fact that higher energy levels are not excited at all throughout the time evolution numerical results time evolution of the von neumann entropy the aim of this section is to study the time evolution of the two particles system introduced above in the framework of the nng model starting from a pure state for each particle which we identify with the lowest energy state defined by the quantum number n in we will define the general meta hamiltonian by coupling via gravitational interaction only the physical system with an hidden system which is the identical copy of it then the time dependent physical density matrix is computed by tracing out the hidden degrees of freedom and the corresponding von neumann entropy is derived as the entanglement entropy with such hidden degrees of freedom the nonunitary physical theory obtained will produce an entropy fluctuation in the closed system chosen and then a fundamental gravitationally induced decoherence which can be clearly distinguished from the usual coarse grained entropy we carry out numerical simulations by fixing for simplicity a number of particles n which is the simplest nontrivial case one can consider in order to show some of the most important peculiarities of nng our model in the first quantization ordinary setting is defined by with hnng g i j xi xand x j xi xj xand x i xand x j in agreement with we write the components of the generic basis meta state as where defines the following cumulative index i i in j j jn and ia is one of the four basis states of the single molecule the quantum numbers we are dealing with are n l m in the following we carry out numerical simulations for a system of n particles so we get basis states and a general meta state with components respectively while the matrix dimension of the whole meta hamiltonian h is the evaluation of the matrix elements for the relevant nonunitary gravitational interaction between the basis meta states is given in detail in the appendix let us now outline the main steps of our simulation a numerical diagonalization gives the eigenvalues and the eigenvectors of h so we get all the ingredients to study the time evolution of the system by choosing as initial state the following general unentangled meta state where iand x eb are the meta eigenstates of h the time evolution will produce the entangled meta state it is now possible to calculate the density matrix of only one molecule of the physical system by tracing out the remaining n degrees of freedom but the key quantity for our work is the density matrix of the physical system which is obtained by tracing out the hidden degrees of freedom that corresponds to split the whole meta system into two parts as every bipartite system identified with the physical and hidden degrees of freedom respectively we get starting from the von neumann entropy definition and x e f kbtr log where k is the boltzmann constant we compute the single particle von neumann entropy s m and the two particle system von neumann entropy s ph the results shown in the following refer to an initial state equal to the eigenstate of the physical energy associated with the nd highest energy eigenvalue e shown in figure the results for the entropies are shown in figure respectively for the following values of the physical parameters ls and ls m kg and s which are compatible with current experiments with trapped ultracold atoms and complex molecules and with an artificially augmented gravitational constant g m kg s sup sup times the real constant to begin with due to gravity induced fluctuations the system entropy shows a net variation over very long times at variance with the case g in which it would have been a constant of motion at the same time single particle entropy which in the ordinary setting is itself constant shows now a modulation by the system entropy itself incidentally it has been verified that the expectation of physical energy is a constant meaning that the non unitary term has no net energy associated with itself but is purely fluctuational besides the density plot see figure shows that another energy level is slightly excited leading to the initial entropy growth to ensure physical consistency with our assumption that the whole meta dynamics is confined within the truncated dimensional hilbert space one can assume suitable anharmonic corrections to the harmonic trap potential leading to a sufficient spacing of higher energy levels for these levels not to be excited at all by all the interactions in the system a further comment is in order about the employed value of gravitational constant throughout the computation the computation in fact has been carried out keeping experimentally accessible values of particle masses and other parameters like scattering length and trap frequency while using a significantly higher value of the real gravitational constant using the real value for the last constant would have produced a numerical noise overcoming the small interesting effect we wanted to see alternatively one can use the real value of g and far from reachable values of the other parameters adopting for example the following scaling of the schroedinger equation incidentally starting from a specific numerical solution the scaling above provides also for a continuous one parameter family of solutions it is worth noting that the simple multiperiodic behavior observed for the entropy is due to the very elementary structure of our system s energy levels together with the fact that the involved gravitational energy is small compared to the separation between levels taking a system with a macroscopic number of particles gravitational energy would very easily overcome the tiny level spacings of the order of sup italic n italic sup as this condition is met and so many different frequencies enter into play we can expect that entropy fluctuations would be strongly suppressed within a timescale proportional to n as can be inferred from the time uncertainty relation conclusions and perspectives the main feature introduced by nng model is a fundamental non unitarity arising from the gravitational interaction between the physical and hidden degrees of freedom the last being an identical copy of the physical system and with a symmetry constraint on the state space as a consequence taking the simplest nontrivial almost realistic physical system of two interacting particles the initially pure state taken as an eigenstate of the physical hamiltonian including the ordinary newtonian potential diffuses and develops over a very long time in a mixture of the states involving neighboring energy levels as a consequence both the system entropy and the single particle entropy manifest a net variation while the expectation of energy remains constant over all the time the very long time scale of the system studied here is compatible with the up to now experience with very small and isolated systems like the systems used to implement basic quantum computation in which quantum coherence is preserved as long as environmental decoherence is controlled one may easily expect that using a more complex system with many particles one would get a much more rapid growth and subsequent stabilization of the system entropy following the formation of a microcanonical ensemble around the initial energy level in fact the accessible hilbert space is rapidly growing as new degrees of freedom are added the entropy is expected to grow consequently while the spacing of energy levels being proportional to exp s becomes infinitesimally small this last circumstance would allow for the excitation of a huge number of surrounding energy levels and transitions among them would be induced even by the very weak gravitational interactions of course on the basis of the poincare s recurrence theorem applied in the meta hilbert space one may expect that after a sufficiently long time the system entropy would diminish going back to zero but the time at which this would happen becomes longer and longer as the number of particles gets thermodynamic relevance it is important to stress that the analysis performed above gives also an in principle operational way to clearly distinguish between the ordinary coarse graining subjective entropy and the fundamental entropy due to the peculiar non unitary gravitational interactions of the model as a future perspective of the present work a system of thermodynamic size should be analytically solved and studied in order to ensure a definite and real ability of the nng model to reproduce the spontaneous relaxation of mesoscopic and macroscopic systems toward thermodynamic equilibrium paving the way to a new foundational basis for the second law of thermodynamics
