on the qubits dynamics in random matrix environment we consider the entanglement evolution of two qubits embedded into disordered multiconnected environment we model the environment and its interaction with qubits by large random matrices allowing for possibility to describe environments of meso and even nanosize we obtain general formulas for the time dependent reduced density matrix of the qubits corresponding to several cases of the qubit environment interaction and initial condition we then workout an analog of born markov approximation to find the evolution of the widely used entanglement quantifiers the concurrence the negativity and the quantum discord we show that even in this approximation the time evolution of the reduced density matrix can be non markovian thereby describing certain memory effects due to the backaction of the environment on qubits in particular we find the vanishing of the entanglement at finite moments and its subsequent revivals entanglement sudden death and entanglement sudden birth our results partly known and partly new can be viewed as manifestation of the universality of certain properties of decoherent qubit evolution which have been found previously in various versions of bosonic macroscopic environment introduction the time evolution of system interacting with large in certain sense environment reservoir bath is basic theme of statistical mechanics macroscopic systems quantum optics small systems and adjacent branches of physics commonly known as the theory of open systems new surge of interest to the theme has been motivated by quantum information theory where the robustness of quantum phenomena entanglement in particular with respect to the decoherence effects of the environment is of primary importance one usually assumes that state of the composite system consisting of given system and and its environment and evolves unitarily via the liouville neumann equation the reduced density matrix of and obtained by tracing out the environment degrees of freedom is usually dissipative and dephasing the partial tracing procedure makes the analysis of and quite non trivial since it is rather difficult if possible to obtain in general an exact and efficient governing equation for and among various approximations of the field one has to mention first the so called markovian approximation arising on the time intervals proportional to the inverse square of the system reservoir interaction in this case one obtains well defined local in time and memoryless dynamics in term of certain differential equation for the reduced density matrix there is however number of important problems where one needs to study the non markovian dynamics in which the environment acts as memory allowing the earlier states of system to affect its later dynamics see for recent reviews one of these problems arises in quantum information theory and is subject of considerable activity over the last two decades it concerns the time evolution of quantum correlations in particular entanglement counterintuitive key property of quantum systems whose state cannot be written as the product of states of their subsystems thereby being quantum analog of the independency property of probability theory the time evolution of quantum systems embedded into an environment degrades in general the quantum correlations hence dynamical aspects of quantum correlations make the link of quantum information theory with the theory of open systems see reviews quantum information theory deals often with bipartite systems basic entity of quantum information theory is two state quantum system known as the qubit its counterpart in the theory of open systems is two level system arising in number of physical situations thus an important problem of the quantum information theory is the analysis of time evolution of where and are the qubits the problem has been actively studied in the last decades in the frameworks of various models of the bosonic environment described by the so called spin boson in this paper we study the entanglement dynamics of two qubits by using large random matrices that have been widely used to describe complex quantum systems of large but not necessary macroscopic size in particular quantum coherence effects see for results and references we consider hamiltonians which are similar to the two qubit versions of spin boson the quantum dynamics and their analysis in our work generalize those introduced in where one qubit embedded into random matrix environment has been considered note that the random matrix models of the dynamics of two qubits and of more general quantum systems embedded into an environment have been already considered see and references therein the main difference between our work and the above works is that they are confined to the heisenberg time scale pertinent for the quantum chaos studies while in our work we deal with shorter time scale commonly used in non equilibrium statistical mechanics and the theory of open systems besides the above works focus mostly on the entanglement characteristics known as the purity and the fidelity while we carry out the simultaneous comparative study of three entanglement characteristics the concurrence the negativity and the quantum discord widely used in quantum information theory and allowing for the study of quite interesting quantum coherence phenomena this makes essentially complementary the results of and our results the paper is organized as follows in section we first briefly outline certain known facts on the qubit dynamics for one and two qubits and on the three widely used entanglement characteristic quantifiers the negativity the concurrence and the quantum discord we then describe our random matrix model of the two qubit dynamics which can be both markovian and non markovian depending on the value of parameters of the model and we comment on related earlier results in the literature in section we present our results both analytic and numeric on the time evolution of the above entanglement quantifiers paying special attention to the entanglement vanishing and revival known as early stage disentanglement or entanglement sudden death esd and entanglement sudden birth esb and their dependence on the markovianity of the model in question we find variety of cases of the entanglement evolution partly known but found in different models of entanglement and partly new this shows that the proposed random matrix models describe sufficiently well interesting properties of entanglement thus can be used for further studies of quantum coherence see this also shows that the properties possess certain amount of universality or robustness to the models used for their description model generalities we will use the setting that has been worked out in number of recent papers on the dynamics of pair of qubits embedded in sufficiently large environment see for reviews in this setting the hamiltonian of the whole composite is here is the hamiltonian of the bipartite system of two qubits and spins level systems etc hand are the hamiltonian of the environments and hand and is the hamiltonian of interaction between the qubits and the environment their concrete form both for the models proposed in this paper and for related earlier models see for reviews is discussed in section here we just outline the general structure of hand and hand and hamiltonian here hand is given by and where hand is the hamiltonians of environments and and jand is an hermitian operators determined by the degrees of freedom of and in other words every qubit has its own environment and its own interaction with the environment hence the qubits are dynamically independent here the entanglement between the qubits for arises only because they are initially entangled see the initial conditions the hamiltonian can describe two initially entangled and excited two level atoms spontaneously emitting into two different cavities two sufficiently well separated impurity spins say nitrogen vacancy centers in diamond microcrystal etc ii hamiltonian here hand is given by and the first qubit is free hand hand aand but the second qubit is as in here also the qubits do not interact and their entanglement for is possible only if they are entangled initially see initial conditions below the free qubit is known as the ancilla or spectator in certain contexts of quantum information theory see iii hamiltonian here again hand is given by hand is the same as in but where jand is the same as jand or jeb in the qubits have common environment here the entanglement between the qubits for is due the initial conditions see the next subsection but also due to the hamiltonian providing an effective interaction between the qubits the hamiltonian can be viewed as particular case of in which the coupling of one of the spin with its environment is switched off likewise the hamiltonians and can be viewed as two limiting cases of more general hamiltonian describing two qubits which interact with an environment via short range interaction indeed denoting rand and the radius of the interaction and the distance between the qubits we can say that the cases rand and and rand and of the general hamiltonian are given by and assuming additionally that the radius rand and of qubit qubit interaction is much smaller than rand and see for more the the density matrix of the composite two qubits plus environment is where and is positive definite and trace one matrix the initial density matrix of the qubits and pand is the projection on pure state of the environment often an eigenstate of hand note that we consider here and below the zero temperature case hence pure states for the environment appropriate for the quantum information theory setting although mixed thermal states the gibbs distribution zand exp hand kt in particular can also be considered define the reduced density matrix of and qubits as where trand denotes the partial trace with respect to the degrees of freedom of and we have where the linear superoperator is known as the influence feynman vernon functional in the theory of open systems and as the quantum channels in quantum information theory an important property of the above three general two qubit hamiltonians is that they are essentially determined by the one qubit hamiltonians indeed let be the superoperator for the composite defined by and and let be the superoperators for then it follows from and where is the free superoperator for the qubit see and according to and the superoperators of reduced evolution quantum channels are this simplifies considerably the analysis of the evolution governed by and which is the case in several physical situations see we will discuss the concrete forms of the above hamiltonians in section here we just note that from the point of view of statistical mechanics and condensed matter theory the hamiltonians and of and seem less interesting than the hamiltonian of since and describe non interacting quantum systems they are however of considerable interest for quantum information theory since the dynamics determined by and allow for the study of the emergence of quantum correlations in pure form without dynamical correlations due to the interaction between the qubits in particular it seems that the hamiltonian could be simple model appropriate for quantum computing where qubits are independent in typical solid state devices besides the dynamical independence of qubits can describe the absence of non local operations in the quantum information protocols dynamical correlations are the case only in the time evolution determined by hamiltonian the corresponding quantum channel cannot be written directly via and see however it follows from that it is constructed from the same operators as in and this facilitate considerably the study of the corresponding evolution see for this channel with bosonic environment and related quantum correlation initial conditions here we describe three families of initial conditions and for the reduced density matrix of two qubits the conditions have been used in variety of recent papers see reviews and references therein we write below for the vectors of the standard product basis of the state space of two qubits where are the basis vectors of the state space of one qubit we will also omit the subindex and in the reduced density matrices below condition the pure state is bell like state becoming the maximally entangled bell state if condition the pure state is another bell like state becoming another bell state for condition the mixed state known as the extended werner state and becoming the werner state for the bound guaranties that wk is positive definite by using the negativity entanglement quantifier it can be shown that wk is entangled if for wk reduces to according to the corresponding states are not entangled if it is easy to find that in the basis all the above initial condition have the so called form which arises in number of physical situations and is maintained during widely used dynamics see for reviews the form is also maintained during the quantum dynamics governed by our random matrix hamiltonians see below in what follows we will call the model of the two qubit evolution the pair consisting of one of hamiltonians and one of initial conditions thus particular model is denoted and for the value of from has to be indicated one qubit random matrix hamiltonian since the system hamiltonian hand in the total hamiltonian is always the hamiltonian of two qubits we have to indicate the environment and the interaction hamiltonians in general formulas they are essentially determined by the one qubit hamiltonians well known and fairly realistic example of such hamiltonian is the spin boson hamiltonian describing spin two level system coupled to large usually macroscopic collection of quantum oscillators bosons the cavity radiation field in quantum optics see for this and other physical realizations the hamiltonian is where are the frequencies of oscillators bk bk are the bosonic creation and annihilation operators and vk are the spin boson coupling constants we obtain from by choosing hand hand hb and hand and hdip an important object determining the large macroscopic behavior of the reduced with respect to boson environment density matrix of is the spectral density whose limit is assumed to be smooth enough the spin boson model proves to be quite non trivial in general and admits number of approximations among them the markov approximations is one of often used in various physical situations as in classical dynamical systems the approximation is the case if the environment characteristic time is much smaller than that of the system the rigorous analysis markov approximation is given in in this approximation the superoperator of has the exponential form where is the slow time see below and the superoperator and can be viewed as quantum analog of the fokker planck operator of classical markov processes there is however wide variety of cases including those of quantum information theory where the markov approximation is not adequate enough see recent reviews one can use in these cases the spin boson hamiltonian and its two spin two qubit versions which are however rather complicated in general several interesting cases are based on exact particular solutions of the spin boson model corresponding to one or two excitation in the composite system and on the lorentzian form of the spectral density see for review being rather special this model spectral density provides an interpolation between the markovian flat spectrum and weak coupling and non markovian narrow spectrum and strong coupling evolutions in the frameworks of the same model in this paper we will use different asymptotically exactly solvable model for the qubit environment evolution which is two qubit extension in the sense of of the one qubit model proposed and studied in in these works and in are replaced by random matrices of large size the resulting formulas for the asymptotically exact solution are also rather complicated even in the one qubit case thus we will confine ourselves to certain asymptotic regime where the time is inverse proportional to the square of the coupling constant see this regime is an essential ingredient to obtain the markov approximation for the spin boson and similar models but it yields in our case both the markovian and the non markovian evolution depending on the form flat or narrow of the density of states of the environment see formulas below which plays the role of the spectral function in our model we will briefly describe the model following and adding its properties not given in these works but important in the present work let be hermitian matrix random or not ej be its eigenvalues and be its density of states where assumed to be smooth enough see furthermore let be random hermitian matrix distributed according to the matrix gaussian law zn exp ntrwn in other words the entries of wn wjk wkj wjk are independent for gaussian random variables such that where the symbol denotes the expectation this is known as the gaussian unitary ensemble see we define the hamiltonian of our composite system qubit plus an environment as the following random matrix see where is the unit matrix thus this is particular case of in which see hand hand mn hand and wn it should be noted that the model yields the same results for any real symmetric or hermitian random matrix in whose entries wjk are independent and identically distributed random variables satisfying however in this case the techniques are more involved requiring an extension of those of random matrix theory for so called wigner matrices see in addition our results are also valid in the case where is random and independent of for all in this case we have to assume that the sequence mn of random matrices is defined for all on the same probability space as well as the sequence wn is independent of wn and satisfies for all typical realizations with probability having and random we can view the second term in as the hamiltonian of typical level reservoir and the third term as typical interaction between the qubit and the reservoir note that the randomness frozen disorder is basic ingredient of the theory of disordered extended systems its successful and efficient use is justified by establishing the selfaveraging property of the corresponding results their validity for the overwhelming majority of realizations of randomness for macroscopically large systems see this guarantees the representativity of expectations of extensive observables allowing one to obtain an adequate description of the system in question by using only expectations for quantum information aspects of the selfaveraging property see recent review in our case the selfaveraging property follows from the bound for the variance of the entries of reduced density matrix corresponding to where is numerical constant according to the bound the selfaveraging property of holds for large and any fixed and even for large if the above suggests that in our model the limit plays the role of the macroscopic limits in statistical mechanics note however that in statistical mechanics the density of states of macroscopic many body system macroscopic environment in particular is exponential in its volume and or in its number of degrees of freedom since the exponent is the entropy of macroscopic system the bosonic environment in our case on the other hand the density of states of our random matrix environment is linear in see common situation in one body problems of condensed matter theory thus interpreting as the volume of reservoir we have to admit that our environment being much larger than our system just one qubit is much less macroscopic than that of statistical mechanics origin note that large random matrices have been widely used to model variety of complex quantum systems including heavy nuclei and atoms meso and nanoscopic particles quantum networks etc not necessarily macroscopic quantum systems thus our model can describe qubit in mesoscopic or even nanoscopic cluster quantum dot quantum network etc in other words we propose the model in which the bosonic quantum gaussian noise that models macroscopically large and many body quantum environments is replaced by the random matrix noise that models smaller quantum environments of mesoscopic or even nanoscopic size returning to we conclude that it allows us to confine ourselves to the mean value for and denoting the limiting mean value we have for the one qubit version of for the model where and are given by contour integrals of analytic functions solving system of two selfconsistent equations see formulas of this is reminiscent to the mean field theories of statistical mechanics where the selfconsistent equations are quite common recall the curie weiss and van der waals equations in fact it is widely believed that random matrices of large size provide kind of mean field models for one body disordered quantum systems the coefficients and depend on numerical parameters see the parameter the limiting value of the eigenvalue of corresponding to its eigenstate in the one qubit analog of pand of and the functional parameter see this allows for variety of asymptotic regimes of statics and dynamics of the model see one of the properties of the random matrix model which can be attributed to its non markovianity is that the infinite time limit of is not an equilibrium measure moreover depends on the initial conditions see formula of this can be viewed as manifestation of the role of the size of the environment in the forgetting the initial conditions during the reduced matrix evolution indeed according to the above random matrices can model extended systems of intermediate size between microscopic and macroscopic which are not necessarily large enough to provide the complete loss of memory on the initial conditions note that this property is unusual and undesirable for equilibrium statistical mechanics since it implies that the long time evolution does not equilibrates the system on the other hand the property could be of interest for quantum information theory since systems which remember forever information about their initial conditions can be resource for storing the quantum information it follows from that the evolution of diagonal entries of the limiting reduced density matrix controlling the amplitude damping and dissipation and that of its off diagonal entry controlling the dephasing and decoherence are dynamically independent in view of the complex form of and see the asymptotic bogolyubov van hove regime was considered in yielding upon passing to the interaction representation in which are the same but get the factor its where and is the limiting density of states of the reservoir note that the dynamics of the diagonal and off diagonal entries of the reduced density matrix are again independent however it cannot be purely dephasing to have zero rate of decay of diagonal entries and non zero rate of off diagonal entries see for pure dephasing evolution in markovian model note also that one obtain simple model with pure dephasing dynamics by replacing by in or in see for rather general version of analogous static model it follows from and that approaches exponentially fast as in the markov case although is not an equilibrium distribution and even depends in general on the initial conditions it is independent of if and only if and in this case thus the dependence of on is generic in the asymptotic regime it is also of interest that formulas and as well as more general formulas contain the both the energy of the reservoir and the energy or rather level spacing of the qubit this is one more manifestation of the above mentioned fact according to which our random matrix environment can be viewed as an one body system similar to those of condensed matter theory where the energies of various constituents can be of the same order of magnitude if however we assume that or that of is flat enough in the interval hence then we obtain from and the first term on the right is the infinite temperature gibbs hence equilibrium distribution of two level system see moreover the whole rhs solves the equation which is the fokker planck equation for the random telegraph signal hence in this simple case of the locally flat density of states of the environment where the dynamics defined by and of the reduced density matrix is evidently markovian in the studies of open quantum systems the memory effects are often ignored and this leads to dynamical semigroups and the memoryless markovian dynamics governed by the born markov lindblad master equation however actual dynamics of quantum systems can deviate from the markovian dynamics this motivated considerable activity in the study of various aspects of non markovian dynamics in the last decades following the activity we will discuss briefly the non markovianity of the dynamics defined by and indeed if the dynamics were markovian hence of the exponential form then the same would be true for its restriction to the two dimensional space of diagonal entries thus would also have the exponential form and according to on the other hand it follows from that and is the diagonal matrix with see it is easy to check that coincide with if and only if is flat in the neighborhood of see when we have the genuine markovian evolution thus includes the markov semigroup but is not markovian itself in general it is of interest to apply to the dynamics one of recent quantitative measure of markovianity see for review given superoperator of and pair of initial density matrices and define where according to quantum dynamics channel is markovian if and only if the idea behind the definition as well as several other see is that if the dynamics is markovian then the distance between the density matrices and resulting from pair of distinct initial conditions via the dynamics in question is monotone decreasing in time is negative signalling the one way flow of information from the system to the environment hence the memoryless dynamics thus the positivity of can be viewed as manifestation of the non markovianity of the dynamics in question hence memory effects resulting from the backflow of the information from the environment to the system it can be shown that for the dynamics and are defined in thus according to the dynamics is non markovian if or ab and is markovian if or ab see although the superoperator is not of exponential form in both cases such possibility has been mentioned in the only exception is the case see of the locally flat density of states of the environment which corresponds to the apparently markovian dynamics according to we will also mention an interesting class of unital superoperators quantum channels which are quantum analogs of doubly stochastic matrices and are defined by the property it is easy to check that the channel defined by and is unital if and only if since and imply we conclude that the properties of the independence of on and the unitality imply the apparently markovian dynamics for more interrelations between the markovianity in the sense of and the unitality of quantum channels see two qubit random matrix hamiltonians we will present now the versions of general two qubit hamiltonians in which the environment hamiltonians and those of the qubits environment interaction are the random matrices that are used in the one qubit hamiltonian we will use the same sub symbols and as in for the corresponding hamiltonians the hamiltonian of two qubits will always be given by where we set sa sb for the technical simplicity for effects due to non identical qubits in another model see hamiltonian here we set hand mn jand wnand where is the matrix see and wnand are two independent random matrices with the same probability distribution as in we obtain the hamiltonian of two qubits each of them interacts via independent random matrices with its own random matrix environment one can also use distinct matrices mnand provided that their limiting density of states of are the same otherwise the final formulas are too complicated ii hamiltonian here in full correspondence with general formulas and the case above we set hand hand mn hand aand and hand band xb wnand thus is the hamiltonian of two identical qubits where only one of them interacts via random matrix with random matrix environment iii hamiltonian here in view of and the case above we choose as the the common environment hamiltonian and jand wnand thus to obtain the hamiltonian of two identical qubits interacting via random matrix with common random matrix environment note that random matrices in particular hamiltonians similar to our hamiltonians have been used in the description of the qubits dynamics although in more generic form which does not possesses the pauli matrix structure see and references therein the pauli matrix structure of the one qubit random matrix hamiltonian has been considered in and later in there are however differences which makes essentially complementary the approaches and results of and related papers and our papers first of all deal with regime where the evolution time varies on the so called heisenberg time scale of the environment the scale is of the order of magnitude of the inverse level spacing of the environment and is quantum analog of poincar time scale where the classical statistical mechanics description fails in the case of random matrix models where is the size of the corresponding matrix this time scale is widely used in the studies of quantum chaos and related delicate phenomena loschmidt echo correlation hole etc see for review on the other hand exploit complementary regime of much shorter than the heisenberg poincar time scale common in non equilibrium statistical mechanics known there as kinetics scale and in the theory of open systems we believe that this time scale is of considerable importance in quantum information theory technically the difference is that use the double limit while we use the limit assuming that the evolution time is independent or at most that see the two different time scales mentioned above and the corresponding energy scales and is independent are well known in the random matrix theory as the global or macroscopic scale or regime and the local or microscopic scales or regime see the local regime requires quite involved and sophisticated techniques and less feasible by now this is why confine themselves to the first order approximation in the qubit environment coupling for the reduced density matrix the work extends the result of on an essentially larger interval of time and the system environment interaction by using the grassmann integration techniques but still remaining in the frameworks of the local regime within the heisenberg time scale on the other hand the global regime is fairly well understood and allow us to find closed expression for the reduced density matrix applicable within the kinetics time scale we believe that the fact that our models reproduce several recent results on the evolution of entanglement its disappearances and revivals see figures found before for bosonic environments see reviews provides serious justification of our approach moreover it yield several new facts on interrelations between the negativity and concurrence see figures another difference between our paper and is that the latter deal mainly with the quantum coherence in particular entanglement characteristics known as the purity and the fidelity and only partly with the concurrence while we carry our rather detailed comparative and asymptotically exact in analysis of three entanglement quantifiers the concurrence the negativity and the quantum discord see section for their definition entanglement quantifiers entanglement having short but highly non trivial mathematical definition state of bipartite system is entangled if it is not tensor product of the states of its parties and and and is quite delicate and complex quantum property admitting wide variety of physical manifestations and potential applications this motivated the introduction and the active study of number of its quantitative characteristics entanglement quantifiers or entanglement witnesses which are functionals of the corresponding state and determine its amount of entanglement see reviews we will consider in this paper three widely used entanglement quantifiers of bipartite states the negativity the concurrence and the quantum discord since there is number of reviews and considerable amount of original works treating these characteristics we will give here only their brief description negativity see reviews if two qubit state acted upon with the partial transposition with respect to one of the two subsystems has negative eigenvalues then it is entangled and vice versa in other words the reservoir is not able to create entanglement of two qubits if and only if the partial transposition preserves its positivity the corresponding numerical characteristic is known as negativity and defined as the sum of absolute values of negative eigenvalues of the partially transposed state pt if has the form then pt has the same form and and we have in this case ii concurrence see reviews it is quite popular entanglement quantifier of two qubit states closely related to another entanglement quantifier known as the entanglement of formation and applicable in general to multiqubit systems we have max where are the eigenvalues of the matrix being the complex conjugate of if density matrix has the form then the concurrence varies from for separable states to for maximally entangled states and its positivity is necessary and sufficient condition for the state to be entangled iii quantum discord see reviews quantum discord has rather non trivial definition the idea behind it is to view genuine quantum correlations as those that are not classical accordingly the quantum discord is defined as the difference between the quantum generalizations of two classically equivalent definitions of the mutual information of the classical information theory quantum discord is non negative in general and is positive for the entangled states however there exist not entangled states having positive discord hence not classical in other words the quantum discord feels subtle difference between product states and classical states and can be viewed as measure of total non classical quantum correlations of bipartite systems and more generally pair correlations in quantum many body systems including those that are not captured by the concurrence and the negativity qubits and the entanglement of formation many qubits in general quantum discord is more robust than entanglement against decoherence and it does not present sudden death phenomena see below unfortunately we are not aware of compact formula for the quantum discord of an arbitrary state similar to and for the negativity and concurrence however for the states arising in our models we found an ansatz that simplifies considerably the numerical analysis where xlog and are the eigenvalues of time evolution of entanglement quantifiers we will present now our results on the time evolution of the negativity the concurrence and the quantum discord for the random matrix models nn given by initial conditions and hamiltonians for two identical qubits each interacting with its own environment for two identical qubits but only one of them interacts with an environment and for two identical qubits both interacting with the same environment let us mention first that for all these models we have an analog of bound providing the selfaveraging property typicality of the reduced density matrices in question for large the corresponding proofs are analogous to that of for the one qubit case see but are rather tedious and we do not present them here the property guarantees the validity of the description of the model in question by using only the mean reduced density matrix the representativity of means recall that the representativity of means is basic general property of statistical mechanics where the expectations are with respect to the gibbs measure in the equilibrium case and with respect to the corresponding non equilibrium distribution in general and of the theory of disordered systems where one has one more expectation with respect to the frozen macroscopic disorder let us also mention that one can consider models with classical environment seemingly simple model could be that with langevin an analog of the total density matrix in this approach is the random positive definite matrix solving langevin the role of the reduced density matrix plays the expectation of this random solution for which one often obtains governing master equation however in this approach the variance of the solution is of the same order of magnitude as its expectation recall the standard langevin equation for the ornstein uhlenbeck random process as result in this case there is no counterpart of bound guaranteeing the representativity of means thus the complete description of the solution the random density matrix is given by its whole probability distribution by using the reduced density matrices for models in and fn can be easily obtained for all three families of initial conditions from the one qubit density matrix given by and for example we have for the model the formulas for all other models in fn are similar as for the models cn of two identical qubits interacting with common environment their reduced density matrix cannot be obtained as the tensor product those for the one qubit case it turns out however that in this case the reduced density matrix can be obtained by generalizing the techniques of yielding corresponding calculations and results are rather involved and diverse and will be published elsewhere here we will only give several interesting we believe examples of the corresponding dynamics for the model in the asymptotic regime and for the maximally entangled case the bell case of the initial conditions see figures and we will present now the result of numerical analysis of our random matrix models it will be convenient to use the energy units where the qubit amplitude of is set to we will start with the measure of the non markovianity of our reduced dynamics of two qubits unfortunately we were not able to find an analog of the one qubit formula for two qubit to carry out explicitly the maximization procedure over all pairs of initial conditions positive definite matrices of trace since however we deal only with three families of initial conditions it seems reasonable to perform the maximization only over the initial states while considering the model nn for given this gives lower bound for the maximum over all the states thus allows us to conclude that the reduced two qubit dynamics for the model nn is not markovian if the bound is positive in particular it can be shown that for the model where the initial conditions are parameterized by the parameter the corresponding restricted maximum is attained for the pairs of the parameter for the unentangled cases of figure gives the plot of the distance for the model one qubit is free and one interacts with its own environment and the maximizing pairs of initial conditions according to the figure the corresponding integral in is thus the reduced two qubit dynamics with parameters indicated in the figure is non markovian by the criterion note that we consider the case where the one qubit dynamics is markovian the distance is monotone decreasing and the rhs of is zero on the other hand in the two qubit model the distance may be both monotone and not monotone in the both cases and for different this can be viewed as manifestation of the increase of the amount of non markovianity of the two qubit reduced dynamics comparing with that of the one qubit reduced dynamics with the same one qubit hamiltonian next we will discuss the negativity and the concurrence we will consider first the models in and fn the corresponding plots are given in figures and these plots as well as numerous other plots that we obtained are qualitatively similar for any ab they decay smoothly and monotonically from their non zero initial values recall that ab and ab correspond to the markovian and the non markovian one qubit dynamics according to it is important that all the plots become zero at finite moment esd and remain zero afterwards an initially entangled state becomes disentangled starting from esd this is the esd phenomenon see also for reviews it is of interest that according to figure in the both models and the esd moments for the concurrence and negativity coincide moreover it can be shown analytically that while we have for any of form hence in spite of rather different definitions and of these entanglement quantifiers they can be closely related in certain cases see for similar fact this is why we give the plot of ni and nf on figure where the above equality is not valid figure shows that esd depends rather non trivially on the choice of the family of the initial conditions and on of the parameter of the family it is also of interest that the plot of concurrence for solid line of figure is quite similar to plot obtained experimentally see we have also proved analytically the relation separating the dependence of the concurrence on the initial conditions cn is the concurrence at and on the hamiltonian is smooth function such that and and are given in and the relation implies that esd is independent of inial conditions parameter in and passing to the models cn determined by hamiltonian of and describing the time evolution of two qubits embedded in common environment we find that their reduced dynamics are more diverse than those of models in and fn figure depicts the concurrence and the negativity in the model with maximally entangled initial condition and with the lorentzian density of states of the environment note that more general function is widely used as model spectral density for special versions of the spin boson dynamics of two qubits see and references therein it follows from figure that for and the parameters indicated in the figure caption the plots of the concurrence and the negativity have two disjoint branches the branch of figure from to esd is quite similar to those of figures and and typical for the markovian evolution monotone decreasing curves however in the model there is the second branch of these quantifiers although with the amplitude which is at most of the maximum amplitude of the first branch the revival of the concurrence and the negativity hence the entanglement after the esd is known as the esb and was found in special versions of the spin boson dynamics where the esd and esb can even appear several times although often with decaying amplitudes see on the other hand in our case the second branches of the concurrence and the negativity tend to non zero value at infinity thereby exhibiting the entanglement trapping phenomenon it is also of interest that for the first branches we have an analog of of while for the second branches the strict analog of is valid except the endpoints of the branch where the both plots equal zero see figure we have also found case of the model where the second branch becomes zero at certain finite esd esb and is zero afterwars one more esd note that since even partial entanglement of large number of copies of bipartite quantum system may be distilled to smaller number of maximally entangled systems many quantum information processing and communication tasks may be carried out as long as there is still some entanglement left this is why the result of figure seems to be of interest the time evolution of the quantum discord is presented on figure figure depicts the evolution of the quantum discord in the model of two identical qubits where only one of them interacts with an environment see and it shows that although particular plots of the figure depend on all model parameters in the qualitative form of the plots depends only on the parameter indeed according to figure all the three plots of decrease sufficiently fast from their initial value to the value about at the dimensionless time equals however for longer times the plots are qualitative different for la markovian one qubit regime according to the plot dashed line is monotone decreasing to its infinite time value which is about of its initial value for non markovian one qubit regime according to the plot solid line attains its minimum which is about of its initial value and then grows slowly to its infinite time value which is about of its initial value and only for the plot dotted dashed line decays monotonically to zero at infinity recall that this is the most genuine markovian regime of our model since in this case we have but not yet and the infinite time reduced density matrix is independent of initial conditions see although is not necessarily of the gibbs form the time evolution of quantum discord in the model corresponding to the maximally entangled bell state of is presented on figure the plot is more structured in particular according to the solid lines on figures and the quantum discord grows monotonically for large times this seems somewhat counterintuitive since one would expect that quantum correlations decrease with time it is also of interest that the plot on figure has plateau which could be interpreted as the freezing of the discord for finite time interval found in several non markovian models with bosonic environment and in certain experiments we conclude that the quantum discord can be preserved and even amplified on certain time intervals of its evolution in the dissipative environment see for discussions and references on the properties of quantum discord in other environments note also that the vanishing of the quantum discord an analog of the esd phenomenon of figures would have in general number of important implications in particular providing an efficient indicator of the classicality of state in question see especially sections iv and viii we have not found an analog of the esd for quantum discord in our models but only either its asymptotic vanishing at infinity or identical vanishing for non entangled initial conditions see and the solid lines on figure thereby confirming the larger robustness of the quantum discord with respect to the decoherent influence of the environment this is well seen from figure depicting the value of quantum discord at infinity for models and as functions of the parameters of the models conclusion in this paper we have considered several schemes of the time evolution of two qubits embedded into an environment the schemes are determined by certain entangled initial conditions and one of three hamiltonians describing each qubit interacts with its own environment one of qubits interacts with its own environment and one is free and both qubits interact with common environment concrete realization of these quite natural schemes is determined by the choice of the hamiltonians of the environment and of its interaction with qubits an often used choice corresponds to the so called spin boson hamiltonian describing macroscopic and many body environment see for review another possibility is to use large random matrices to model complex disordered and not necessary macroscopic environment one has to choose then the time the energy scale of random matrix theory we choose the so called global regime which provides the description analogous to that of non equilibrium statistical mechanics and the theory of open systems see however works for another choice known as the local regime pertinent to the quantum chaos studies and leading to complementary results obtained models are asymptotically exactly solvable in the limit of large matrix size and allow us to analyze variety of the qubit dynamics interpolating between the markovian memoryless and non markovian including the environment backaction dynamics we have examined three widely used numerical characteristics quantifiers of quantum correlations entanglement in particular the negativity the concurrence and the quantum discord and we found number of patterns of time dependence of these quantifiers part of patterns is qualitatively similar to those obtained previously in the frameworks of bosonic models the vanishing and the revival of entanglement its freezing and locking while another part consists of new patterns connections between the negativity and the concurrence two seemingly different entanglement quantifiers the monotone growth of the discord for large times relevant parameters determining pattern we believe that these findings manifest the universality the independence of the model of certain fundamental properties of entanglement as well as indicate new directions of its studies
