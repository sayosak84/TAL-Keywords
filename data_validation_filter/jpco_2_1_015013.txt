drift diffusion model of hole migration in diamond crystals via states of valence and acceptor bands ionization equilibrium and dc electrical conductivity of crystalline diamond are considered for the temperature in the vicinity of which valence band band conductivity is approximately equal to hopping conductivity via acceptors for the first time we find explicitly in the form of definite integrals the fundamental ratio of diffusion coefficient to drift mobility for both band holes and holes hopping via hydrogen like acceptors for the temperature the known ratios follow from the obtained ones as particular cases the densities of the spatial distributions of acceptors and hydrogen like donors as well as of holes are considered to be poissonian and the fluctuations of electrostatic potential energy are considered to be gaussian the dependence of exchange energy of band holes on temperature is taken into account the thermal activation energy of hopping conduction as function of the concentration of boron atoms as acceptors is calculated for temperature without the use of any adjustable parameters the results of calculations quantitatively agree with data obtained from the measurements of hopping conductivity of diamond with boron concentration from to cm on the insulating side of the mott phase transition introduction the ionization equilibrium between band valence band holes and acceptor impurity atoms in however at such temperature tj when the dc band electrical conduction is approximately equal to the dc hopping electrical conduction via hydrogen like acceptors it is necessary to consider jointly the ionization equilibrium and the drift diffusion migration of holes it is important for the wide bandgap semiconductors like boron doped crystalline diamond for which tj is in the region from liquid nitrogen to room temperatures and higher for the narrow bandgap semiconductors like boron doped crystalline silicon temperature tj is usually in the region from liquid helium to liquid hydrogen temperatures such difference in temperatures tj between boron doped diamond and boron doped silicon is connected with that the thermal energy of ionization by electrically neutral boron atoms in diamond is eight times greater than the one in silicon let us note that the wide bandgap semiconductors for which the energy of electron affinity is less than the band gap are important for applications in high temperature electronics and power optics in particular heavily boron doped diamonds are attractive for studies of superconductivity at liquid helium temperature and higher see and application as electrodes for detection of neurochemicals in the human brain at room temperature the purpose of this article is to calculate theoretically in the framework of the drift diffusion model the ratio of the diffusion coefficient to the drift mobility for both band holes and acceptor band holes in boron doped diamond crystals of in contrast to other works we consider the temperature region where the contributions of free band holes and holes hopping via acceptor band are comparable let us consider bulk homogeneous diamond crystal that contains band holes with the average concentration majority impurity hydrogen like acceptors boron atoms in the charge states and with the total average concentration and minority impurity hydrogen like donors all in the charge state with the average concentration kn where is the compensation ratio of acceptors by donors the electrical neutrality condition at ionization equilibrium for random distribution

acceptors holes in the band with total energy above the threshold of drift diffusion migration ev see figure are delocalized over the entire volume of the crystal between scattering or recombination events holes in the band these completely free band holes characterize the dc electrical conductivity and the stationary hall effect we will denote their concentration as pmob on the other hand holes in the band with energy ep ev can only move within restricted regions of crystal and are probably responsible for the increase of the macroscopic permittivity in doped semiconductors see let ploc be the concentration of partially free band holes the total concentration of band holes is pmob ploc we will show that ploc on the insulating side of the concentration transition insulator metal mott transition for in the limit of zero temperature in boron doped moderately compensated diamond of impurity atoms are assumed to be localized at sites of diamond crystal lattice however because holes can transfer from acceptors into the band and back as well as hop between acceptors the charge states of immobile acceptors and migrate within crystal conversely all donors permanently remain in the charge state so their charge states do not migrate at temperatures tj the electrical conductivity is mainly determined by holes hopping from acceptors in the charge state to acceptors in the charge state the hc regime in figure turbulent jumping relay migration of holes is realized in the vicinity of the temperature tj when the band and the hopping via acceptors electrical conductivities are approximately equal to each other jc regime at temperatures tj the electrical conductivity is mainly determined by band holes that move freely in the crystal matrix between events of scattering on phonons and impurity atoms bc regime the expression for the density of the stationary direct electric current of mobile ions and conduction electrons in solids taking into account drift and diffusion components of the current was first written by wagner see also the expression for the density of stationary hopping current of electrons via hydrogen like donors in the charge states and in the drift diffusion approximation was first obtained in in crystalline semiconductor of note that in the framework of the linear stationary theory of electron and hole transport in semiconductors it is assumed

gaussian probability density function and for the fluctuations of acceptor energy levels ea relative to the average value over the crystal where wa is the effective width of the acceptor band figure taking into account only coulomb interaction between the two nearest point charges in the crystal we find the following expression for the effective width of the acceptor band wa which is equal to the root mean square fluctuation of the electrostatic energy of the ionized acceptor where nch kn kn is the concentration of all point charged particles in the crystal the root mean square fluctuation of the electrostatic potential energy of band hole is smaller than wa due to smoothing of the potential with characteristic amplitude wa by hole within the scale of its de broglie wavelength where is the concentration of band holes wa is determined by equation from equations and it is seen that the quantities wa and depend on the concentration of band holes the concentration of ionized acceptors and the compensation ratio from formulas and for band holes and holes in acceptor band we obtain where the dimensionless parameters and characterize the deviation of the ratio of the diffusion coefficient

nondegenerate gas of band holes for the wide acceptor band wa kbt from equation it follows that where ef kbtln wa is found from the condition erf which is followed from equation note that dh mh value according to equations and increases with the amplitude of electrostatic potential energy fluctuations wa this means that the hopping mobility mh of holes decreases more rapidly comparing to their diffusion coefficient dh this is explained by the fact that the actual trajectory of hole diffusing via acceptors on average passes through the lower barriers as compared to the barriers that are produced by an external electric field and are responsible for the drift mobility mh of this hole the parameter enters the expression for the coefficient of the differential thermo emf for hopping
