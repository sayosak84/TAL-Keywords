drift diffusion model of hole migration in diamond crystals via states of valence and acceptor bands ionization equilibrium and dc electrical conductivity of crystalline diamond are considered for the temperature t j in the vicinity of which valence band v band conductivity is approximately equal to hopping conductivity via acceptors for the first time we find explicitly in the form of definite integrals the fundamental ratio of diffusion coefficient to drift mobility for both v band holes and holes hopping via hydrogen like acceptors for the temperature t j the known ratios follow from the obtained ones as particular cases the densities of the spatial distributions of acceptors and hydrogen like donors as well as of holes are considered to be poissonian and the fluctuations of electrostatic potential energy are considered to be gaussian the dependence of exchange energy of v band holes on temperature is taken into account the thermal activation energy of hopping conduction as a function of the concentration of boron atoms as acceptors is calculated for temperature t t j without the use of any adjustable parameters the results of calculations quantitatively agree with data obtained from the measurements of hopping conductivity of diamond with boron concentration from to cm i e on the insulating side of the mott phase transition introduction the ionization equilibrium e g between v band valence band holes and acceptor impurity atoms in p however at such a temperature tj when the dc v band electrical conduction is approximately equal to the dc hopping electrical conduction via hydrogen like acceptors it is necessary to consider jointly the ionization equilibrium and the drift diffusion migration of holes it is important for the wide bandgap semiconductors like boron doped crystalline diamond for which tj is in the region from liquid nitrogen to room temperatures and higher for the narrow bandgap semiconductors like boron doped crystalline silicon temperature tj is usually in the region from liquid helium to liquid hydrogen temperatures such a difference in temperatures tj between boron doped diamond and boron doped silicon is connected with that the thermal energy of ionization by electrically neutral boron atoms in diamond is eight times greater than the one in silicon let us note that the wide bandgap semiconductors for which the energy of electron affinity is less than the band gap are important for applications in high temperature electronics and power optics in particular heavily boron doped diamonds are attractive for studies of superconductivity at liquid helium temperature and higher see e g and application as electrodes for detection of neurochemicals in the human brain at room temperature the purpose of this article is to calculate theoretically in the framework of the drift diffusion model the ratio of the diffusion coefficient to the drift mobility for both v band holes and acceptor band holes in boron doped diamond crystals of p in contrast to other works we consider the temperature region where the contributions of free v band holes and holes hopping via acceptor band are comparable let us consider a bulk homogeneous diamond crystal that contains v band holes with the average concentration p a majority impurity hydrogen like acceptors boron atoms in the charge states and with the total average concentration n and a minority impurity hydrogen like donors all in the charge state with the average concentration kn where k is the compensation ratio of acceptors by donors the electrical neutrality condition at ionization equilibrium for a random distribution of impurity atoms and holes over the crystal volume is where n n n is the average concentration of ionized acceptors i e acceptors in the charge state n is the average concentration of electrically neutral acceptors holes in the v band with a total energy e above the threshold of drift diffusion migration ev see figure are delocalized over the entire volume of the crystal between scattering or recombination events holes in the v band these completely free v band holes characterize the dc electrical conductivity p and the stationary hall effect we will denote their concentration as pmob on the other hand holes in the v band with energy ep ev can only move within restricted regions of a crystal and are probably responsible for the increase of the macroscopic permittivity in doped semiconductors see e g let ploc be the concentration of partially free v band holes the total concentration of v band holes is p pmob ploc we will show that ploc p on the insulating side of the concentration transition insulator metal mott transition for k in the limit of zero temperature in boron doped moderately compensated k diamond of p impurity atoms are assumed to be localized at sites of diamond crystal lattice however because holes can transfer from acceptors into the v band and back as well as hop between acceptors the charge states of immobile acceptors and migrate within crystal conversely all donors permanently remain in the charge state so their charge states do not migrate at temperatures t tj the electrical conductivity is mainly determined by holes hopping from acceptors in the charge state to acceptors in the charge state the hc regime in figure turbulent jumping relay migration of holes is realized in the vicinity of the temperature tj when the v band p and the hopping h via acceptors electrical conductivities are approximately equal to each other jc regime at temperatures t tj the electrical conductivity is mainly determined by v band holes that move freely in the crystal matrix between events of scattering on phonons and impurity atoms bc regime the expression for the density of the stationary direct electric current of mobile ions and conduction electrons in solids taking into account drift and diffusion components of the current was first written by wagner see also the expression for the density of stationary hopping current of electrons via hydrogen like donors in the charge states and in the drift diffusion approximation was first obtained in in a crystalline semiconductor of p note that in the framework of the linear stationary theory of electron and hole transport in semiconductors it is assumed that in the expressions for

energy levels of localized states it is shown that the ratio of the diffusion coefficient to the drift mobility is equal to kbt e finally the values of effective hole or electron concentrations involved in hopping migration via hydrogen like impurities in crystalline semiconductors are determined in for example for a p for an n however derivations of the relation dh mh for holes hopping via acceptors and electrons hopping via donors in used particular forms of the expressions for nhp and nhn that are only suitable for limiting values of the compensation ratio k or k of the majority

following expression for the effective width of the acceptor band wa which is equal to the root mean square fluctuation of the electrostatic energy of the ionized acceptor where nch n kn p kn p n is the concentration of all point charged particles in the crystal the root mean square fluctuation of the electrostatic potential energy u of a v band hole w is smaller than wa due to smoothing of the potential with characteristic amplitude wa by a hole within the scale of its de broglie wavelength where p is the concentration of v band holes wa is determined by equation from equations and it is seen that the quantities wa and w depend on the concentration of v band holes p the concentration of ionized acceptors n and the compensation ratio k from formulas and for v band holes and holes in acceptor band we obtain where the dimensionless parameters p and h characterize the deviation of the ratio of the diffusion coefficient to the drift mobility from the classical value kbt e according to these parameters are let us note that in writing equations we assumed that on the insulating side of the mott transition v band holes and holes of acceptor band coexist in the crystal matrix separately consequently in the derivation of equations and we assumed that the densities of states in the v band g and in the acceptor band and x e a are weakly compared to the probabilities of filling hole states f and f f dependent on the fermi level ef the quantities p and h characterize the difference in the extent to which the diffusion coefficient and the mobility of v band and acceptor band holes are affected by fluctuations of the electrostatic potential energy in the crystal the fluctuations decrease drift mobilities of holes stronger than their diffusion coefficients equations and are supported by experiments measuring the ratio of the diffusion coefficient to the drift mobility of holes p and h in amorphous hydrogenated silicon at temperature tj where the turbulent jumping or relay regime of hole transport probably occurs for the region of high temperature t ti at which practically all acceptors are ionized the concentration of v band holes p k n in particular at t ti the fluctuations of the potential energy of holes are small wp kbt and ev kbt from equation taking into account equations we find see also where fj yf is the fermi dirac integral yf ef kbt is the ratio of the fermi level ef to the thermal energy kbt two particular cases follow from equation equation for an ideal nondegenerate gas of v band holes of p let us note that in it is unreasonably stated that the relation dp p kbt e is also valid for an ideal degenerate gas of holes for the region of low temperature t tj when p nh k k n only a fraction of acceptors n n k is ionized the other acceptors are electrically neutral n n k for the narrow acceptor band wa kbt from equation taking into account equations we find h i e for hopping via acceptors holes dh mh kbt e which coincides with equation for ideal nondegenerate gas of v band holes for the wide acceptor band wa kbt from equation it follows that where a ef e a kbtln a wa is found from the condition k erf a which is followed from equation note that dh mh value according to equations and increases with the amplitude of electrostatic potential energy fluctuations wa this means that the hopping mobility mh of holes decreases more rapidly comparing to their diffusion coefficient dh this is explained by the fact that the actual trajectory of a hole diffusing via acceptors on average passes through the lower barriers as compared to the barriers that are produced by an external electric field and are responsible for the drift mobility mh of this hole the parameter h enters the expression for the coefficient of the differential thermo emf for hopping migration of holes via acceptors to calculate p and h using equations and we need to establish the dependence of the energy of the acceptor band
