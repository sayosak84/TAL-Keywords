positive impact of decoherence on spin squeezing in ghz and w states we study spin squeezing behaviour in tripartite unsqueezed maximally entangled greenberger horne zeilinger ghz and w states under various decoherence channels with kitagawa ueda criteria in order to search spin squeezing sudden death sssd and perform the analysis of spin squeezing production we use bit flip phase flip bit phase flip amplitude damping phase damping and depolarization channels in the present study in literature the influence of decoherence has been studied usually as a destroying element on the contrary here we investigate the positive impact of decoherence which produces spin squeezing in unsqueezed ghz and w states under certain channels our careful study shows that ghz state remains unsqueezed under aforementioned channels except bit phase flip and depolarization channels on the other hand all the decoherence channels produce spin squeezing in w state so we find that ghz is more robust in comparison to w state in the sense of spin squeezing production under decoherence most importantly we find none of the decoherence channels produce sssd in either of the states introduction the phenomenon of squeezing exist in light from a long time in literature further the concept has been investigated in the context of spin systems by kitagawa ueda ku in so called spin squeezing spin squeezing attracted much attention of quantum information community as it has its lucid connection with entanglement many features of spin squeezing have been investigated to detect the multipartite and pairwise entanglement even though negative pairwise entanglement in quantum systems a class of spin squeezing inequalities also established for the same purpose enhancement of sensitivity and precision in quantum metorology is an important aspect which has been achieved by using many techniques spin squeezing is one of these squeezing of spins play an important role for quantum metrology and magnetometery to improve the sensitivity and precision because of its ability to reduce the quantum noise early experimental manifestations of spin squeezing is demonstrated in varieties of physical systems such as in entangled ion trap systems in bose einstein condensate bec through repulsive interactions measurements by partial projection squeezing of huge ensemble of atoms in cavities through light matter interaction to produce atomic clocks gravitational interferometers and in many qubit systems there are many the definition depends on the here we deal with spin squeezing which further demand any mathematical criteria to know its degree there are many criteria present for spin squeezing ku is one of the highly studied criteria which also have its experimental manifestations ku criteria has major drawback as it is mostly suitable for symmetric states and fail to check the spin squeezing under local unitary operations on the symmetric and non symmetric states however generalised version of ku criteria is developed by usha devi et al for the states which are invariant under unitary transformations for non symmetric as well as for symmetric states a well known example of symmetric states which are invariant under particle exchange is coherent spin state css primarily spin squeezing with ku criteria has been studied in css with one and two axis twisting hamiltonians which are nonlinear hamiltonians and used to produce spin squeezing in separable css the best squeezing scales achieved with n number of particles by these hamiltonians are oth n and tth n respectively without decoherence affects the one axis twisting hamiltonain under decoherence assumed in the form of particle loss has been studied in two mode bec and they have been observed the scaling of spin squeezing with one particle loss is n for two particle loss the scaling is independent of n and for three particle loss it is n further the spin squeezing production with two axis twisting model with decoherence in the form of particle loss has been studied by a andre et al with raman scattering based approach early studies of decoherence in spin squeezing with css have been investigated under amplitude damping pure dephasing and depolarizing channels by wang et al this study have shown that css goes under spin squeezing sudden death sssd under decoherence except amplitude damping channel the phenomenon of sssd is inspired by entanglement sudden death which is widely studied in many physical settings so investigations of spin squeezing behaviour under decoherence in css motivate us to carry out the study in another symmetric states here in the present study we consider tripartite maximally entangled greenberger horne zeilinger ghz and w states which are symmetric under particle exchange the aim of the present study is two fold we be diligent to search the phenomenon sssd and some interesting results of spin squeezing production in these states under decoherence the structure of the paper is as follows in section we give the brief formulation of spin squeezing which is used to reckon the behaviour of spin squeezing throughout the paper in section and its subsequent sections from to we proceed the study on spin squeezing in tripartite ghz and w states under decoherence channels like bit flip phase flip bit phase flip amplitude damping phase damping and depolarization in section we provide the conclusion of the paper in the last we have added an appendix for detailed calculations of variance j spin squeezing formulation in this section we cover basic definition of spin squeezing and its brief mathematical formulation bases on ku criteria in the treatment of spin squeezing formulation covered in literature here we apply efforts for simplified and straight forward calculations of spin squeezing expression along with the calculations of variance j added in appendix in many body physics the collective behaviour of observables play an important role because the individual particles can not be apart from it spin squeezing also have strong connection with multipartite entanglement to proceed the formulation of spin squeezing in n body spin systems we begin with the collective angular momentum jand x d the collective angular momentum jand x d can be represented in three dimensional cartesian coordinate system as below where jx jy and j are angular momentum components along x y and z axis respectively in euclidean space further we transform the axis of euclidean space i e x y z to spherical coordinate system using the orthonormal vectors nand x d nand x d nand x d this transformation is needed to remove the dipolar squeezing and to generate the spin squeezing in the system the unit orthonormal vectors used for transformation are given below the collective angular momentum vector jand x d xyz in old coordinate system can be transformed in new coordinate system by using the rotation matrix as in l h s of the above equation jn jn jn are the components of the collective angular momentum jnand x d in new spherical coordinate system along the bases nand x d nand x d nand x d further simplification of equation leads as the above equations give the projection of the vector jand x d xyz along the unit vectors nand x d nand x d nand x d knowing the components jx jy jz and the set of angles gives the clue to obtain the components jn jn jn of the vector jnand x d in n spin system the angular momentum vectors of individual spins may be in different directions so we need to calculate the mean values of the angular momentum components in x y and z directions these components form a mean spin vector jand x d mean as obtained below the mean spin vector depends on the state of the system here it is important to mention that we rotate the cartesian coordinate system with the angles such that the mean spin vector jand x d mean align along the vector nand x d in new spherical coordinate system this makes calculations simple and assist the removal of dipolar spin squeezing also further the mean spin vector in new spherical coordinate system can be expressed as with equations play an important role in calculating the spin squeezing which basically revel the connections of mean components of the vector jand x d means in spherical coordinate system to the mean components of the vector jand x d mean in cartesian coordinate system to go towards the mathematical definition of spin squeezing first we give the light on the arrangement of the vectors nand x d nand x d and nand x d which are orthonormal let assume the orthonormal vectors nand x d and nand x d are in the same plane denoted as n obviously this plane is perpendicular to the vector nand x d i e n nand x d we can choose any arbitrary vector lying in the plane n and making an arbitrary angle with the vector nand x d this vector is called nand x d which is automatically perpendicular to the vector nand x d the arrangement of the vectors nand x d nand x d nand x d nand x d jand x d mean and oband x d is shown in the figure oband x d is the projection vector of jand x d mean in xy plane as we know the vectors nand x d and nand x d are mutually perpendicular unit vectors which are staying in two dimensional plane i e n and can be written as nand x d t and nand x d t here we mention that rotation of the vector nand x d with an angle produce the vector nand x d so nand x d can be obtained as where s is the orthogonal unitary rotation matrix expressed as simplification of equation produce the vector nand x d which is obtained below the vector nand x d lies in the plane n in spherical coordinate system and play an important role for the definition of spin squeezing the definition of spin squeezing is given as the minimum value of the variance of the total angular momentum j along the vector nand x d is less than or equal to the stranded quantum limit i e where j is the spin quantum number and given as j n rearranging the equation we get where n is the number of spins in the system and is the spin squeezing parameter if the state is unsqueezed and there is no quantum correlation present in the state for pure css uncorrelated state if there are certain we can easily obtain the projection of the vector jand x d n along the vector nand x d which produce the vector jand x d this vector is obtained as the variance of the vector jand x d and its optimization is obtained in the appendix which is expressed as where the coefficients m n and o are given below putting the value from the equation in we get the spin squeezing as this is called ku criteria for spin squeezing the condition represents the state is spin squeezed and with the state is unsqueezed the criteria also give the indications about the separability and entanglement of a state the parameter exhibits that the state is entangled and with the state is separable but this is true only for symmetric states the criteria fails for non symmetric states and under local operations to overcome this difficulty a generalised ku criteria is developed in spin squeezing under decoherence in ghz and w states in this section we study the spin squeezing behaviour in tripartite maximally entangled ghz and w states under decoherence we here consider that individual qubits face the decoherence this situation is modelled by kraus operators formalism to start with the tripartite maximally entangled ghz and w states can be written as both the states are symmetric under particle exchange the corresponding initial density matrices of these states can be obtained as ghz and w in subsequent subsections we proceed the study under bit flip phase flip bit phase flip amplitude damping phase damping and depolarization channels let initial density matrix passes through any one of the quantum channel than by using kraus operators the decoherence prone density matrix can be written as where n is the number of kraus operators for a particular channel and ei j k are the kraus operators for three qubits i j and k which are operating independently the state represents the initial state either ghz or w the equation will be used for the decoherence analysis in spin squeezing throughout the paper for various quantum channels bit flip channel in this subsection we study the spin squeezing behaviour of ghz and w states under bit flip channel bit flip error is a common error produced in many physical systems a common example is the stray magnetic field which may flip the bit and produce this error to begin with we write the kraus operators of bit flip channel which are given as the bit flip channel has two kraus operators we plug in these operators with n in equation putting ghz for ghz state and w for w state in equation we get the decoherence prone density matrix bfdp for bit flip channel which is used to reckon the spin squeezing in ghz and w states by using equation the expressions of degree of spin squeezing in ghz and w states are obtained as first we reckon the behaviour of spin squeezing in ghz state with the equation in the absence of bit flip error i e p the equation become free from the angle and we get ghz which revels the state is initially unsqueezed taking the other side of the discussion we can also look at the length of mean spin vector in ghz state which is zero in the absence of decoherence we calculate the length of the mean spin vector r for ghz state in the decoherence prone matrix bfdp by using the equation a which is still found as zero and independent from the parameter p so the result r in the state bfdp represents the origin o in the figure which revels that in ghz state so by putting in equation we get the parameter p vanish from the equation and we get ghz this concludes that the ghz state remains unsqueezed and do not feel the influence of bit flip channel next we give the look at equation in which the spin squeezing parameter w is the function of three parameters p we plot w versus parameter p with different values of in figure we have calculated the length of mean spin vector for w state in the absence of bit flip error i e p it is obtained as r which is reverse case to the ghz state so there is a possibility for spin squeezing and its production in w state giving the look at the subfigure of figure with we find with p and the parameter w is always equal to which concludes that as long as the mean spin vector is along the z axis the state remain unsqueezed and the state remain unaffected by bit flip channel but as the mean spin vector rotates with and the spin squeezing produces in the state direction of the mean spin vector has important significance which play the role to determine the plane of reduced variances which lie normal to the direction of mean spin vector by giving the look at the figure with we find the behaviour of spin squeezing parameter w such that the bit flip parameter p and rotation angle produce the spin squeezing in the state but it is important to note that with p the parameter w and there is no spin squeezing produced here we mention that the movement of mean spin direction represents the movement of projection vector oband x d in xy plane with an angle and vice versa with p as the projection vector oband x d rotates in the xy plane with an angle the spin squeezing parameter achieves the value as w so spin squeezing production takes place the condition represents that the mean spin lie in xz plane and represents that the mean spin lie in the plane yz as mean spin or projection vector oband x d rotates with in xy plane the degree of spin squeezing rises with p and decreases with p bases on discussion for the results obtained in figure we conclude that the w state is fragile under bit flip channel and channel produces spin squeezing in the state phase flip channel in this section we study the spin squeezing behaviour of ghz and w states under phase flip channel the kraus operators of phase flip channel are given below by using the equation with n we can obtain the decoherence prone matrix corresponding to the phase flip channel as fpdp further calculating the spin squeezing parameter in ghz and w states by using the equation we get equation reveals the equation is free from the decoherence parameter p and simplification of the equation leads as ghz in fact this equation is similar to equation with p with ghz we conclude that ghz state do not feel decoherence by phase flip channel and avoid spin squeezing production now we concentrate at the squeezing parameter obtained for w state in equation the squeezing parameter w is the function of three parameters p with varying values of these parameters the results are plotted in figure at under phase flip channel we obtain the similar result as obtained with for bit flip channel as shown in figure this result shows that as long as the mean spin vector is along the z axis the w state remains initially unsqueezed and unaffected by phase flip channel here in figure with except spin squeezing plots have round behaviour in the vicinity of p however for bit flip channel the spin squeezing was sharply meeting at p at p and p the degree of spin squeezing obtained under this channel is same as obtained for bit flip channel with varying values of when mean spin vector is in xz plane with the spin squeezing is produced only with p after p the state is unsqueezed once the mean spin vector switch to yz plane with the state is squeezed only with p as the projection vector ob rotates in xy plane with there are good features of spin squeezing production here we mention that phase flip channel has the capability to produce spin squeezing in w state bit phase flip channel in this section we study the behaviour of spin squeezing under bit phase flip channel this channel flip the bit along with the emergence of relative phase factor in the state the kraus operators of bit phase flip channel are given below we use the equation with n and obtain the decoherence prone density matrix after passing through the channel as bfpdp by using bfpdp the spin squeezing parameter for ghz and w states are obtained as looking at the equation the parameter ghz is the function of p in the absence of decoherence i e p we get ghz hence ghz state is initially unsqueezed as the direction of mean spin vector i e and the value of parameter p increases the ghz state become squeezed the result is shown in figure we also observe in the figure with p the squeezing parameter achieve negative values which is an indicator that the channel induces negative correlations in the state with p as the value of parameter p increases the degree of spin squeezing exponentially increases here we conclude the bit phase flip channel has the capability to produce spin squeezing in ghz state further for w state giving the glance to equation we find the squeezing parameter is the function of three parameters p for the equation becomes free from the angle and remains the function of parameter p only but it is not true with with the mean spin vector in this case is along the z axis and result is plotted in figure which reveals that as the value of probability increases with p the degree of spin squeezing exponentially increases but there is no spin squeezing produced in the state with p further observing the figure with reveals as the direction of mean spin vector changes the degree of spin squeezing exponentially grows with varying values of as the value of the angle tends to the squeezing is produced with higher values of p beyond the range p here we find the bit phase flip channel produces spin squeezing with p in both the ghz and w states so both the ghz and w sates exhibit fragile behaviour w r t bit phase flip channel and channel has better positive impact on spin squeezing production amplitude damping channel in this section we study the spin squeezing under amplitude damping channel this channel is used to describe the dissipation of the interaction between quantum systems and its environment for example the spontaneous emission of the photon from a quantum system in actual the amplitude damping channel describe the energy loss in the system the kraus operators of amplitude damping channel are given below where is the damping rate for the channel we obtain the decoherence prone density matrix addp corresponding to the amplitude damping channel by using the equation with n further the spin squeezing parameters for ghz and w states are calculated as below with simplification of the equation leads as ghz we find the squeezing parameter ghz is independent from decoherence parameter t and angle so it implies that amplitude damping channel do not exhibit the spin squeezing production in ghz state further equation is used to explore the results for w state these results are shown in figure when mean spin vector is along the z axis with the equation leads the value w which represents the state is unsqueezed as the value of the parameter t increases with variations in the angle the spin squeezing is produced in the state further we find there are good features of spin squeezing production with t it is found with the state is always unsqueezed we notice as the mean spin vector rotates over the plane xy with there are nice plots of spin squeezing production which are clearly shown in figure with increasing values of parameter here we find w state shows fragile character under the specified channel and channel has good capability to produce spin squeezing phase damping channel in this section we study the spin squeezing behaviour under phase damping channel phase damping channel is the model to represent the information loss in quantum system because of the relative phase produced in the system with system environment interaction this channel do not involve the energy loss in the system as it is done in the case of amplitude damping channel recently it is observed that spin squeezing can be produced with phase damping channel in the system by using quantum non demolition interaction so it is important to study the affect of this channel on spin squeezing the kraus operators are given for this channels as below we obtained decoherence prone density matrix pdcdp by putting n in equation further we have calculated the spin squeezing parameters for phase damping channel for both the ghz and w states these are obtained below with simplification of equation shows that for ghz state the spin squeezing parameter is obtained as ghz it represents the state is unsqueezed and channel do not produce spin squeezing in the state further for w state with the equation we find at the squeezing parameter is w so it implies as long as the mean spin vector is along the z axis with the w state is unsqueezed for higher values of the parameter the results are plotted in figure we found as the mean spin vector is in xz plane with the spin squeezing has not been produced in the state while the rotation of mean spin vector with produces spin squeezing with the increasing values of decoherence parameter t depolarization channel under this section we study the spin squeezing behaviour under depolarization channel this channel is widely studied in polarization encoding in quantum information the map of depolarization is described as it lives the system in fully mixed state with the probability p and the systems is unchanged with the probability p the kraus operators for depolarization channels are given below we obtained the density matrix pdcdp by putting n in equation further we obtained the spin squeezing parameters for ghz and w states with pdcdp these are obtained below with looking at the equation we find the squeezing parameter for ghz state is the function of the damping rate t and independent from the parameters it implies that the mean spin can be in any direction in the space we have plotted this function in figure at t we have ghz the state is initially unsqueezed but as the depolarization rate increases the parameter ghz achieve the value less than one and spin squeezing is produced in the state the degree of spin squeezing decay exponentially and stay at ghz this channel shows lucid behaviour for spin squeezing production in ghz state and the state is very much fragile under this channel for w state we study the equation we find at the equation convert into the equation and spin squeezing in w state exhibit the same behaviour as found for ghz state this result is shown in figure with looking at subfigures of figure we find as the values of increases the spin squeezing produces in w state and decreases exponentially as the depolarization rate t increases most importantly we have found as the mean spin vector lies in xz or in yz plane with still the spin squeezing is produced in w state under depolarization channel we have found the depolarization channel has great impact to produce spin squeezing in both the ghz and w states conclusion in this article we investigate the positive impact of decoherence on spin squeezing in tripartite maximally entangled ghz and w states under bit flip phase flip bit phase flip amplitude damping phase damping and depolarization channels initially ghz state is unsqueezed and w state is also unsqueezed as long as its mean spin vector is along the z axis when decoherence is applied we have found the spin squeezing production in these states however ghz state remain unsqueezed under all the decoherence channels except bit phase flip and depolarization channels the w state shows fragile behaviour under decoherence and it permits all the channels to produce spin squeezing in it and exhibit less robust character than ghz state more specifically we have found depolarization channel has lucid characteristic to produce good degree of spin squeezing in both the ghz and w states we also investigated that none of the state exhibit spin squeezing sudden death under any one of the decoherence channels there are extensive experimental efforts to generate spin squeezing in varieties of physical systems such as bec ultra cold atoms nv diamond centres gravitational interferometers atomic clocks etc as quantum systems are too evasive and the phenomenon of decoherence is unavoidable which has its negative impact on quantum systems but investigating the positive aspects for the same may lead to new outcomes so in this direction the present study theoretically explore the impact of decoherence on spin squeezing as a positive factor in ghz and w states which may be useful for quantum information community
