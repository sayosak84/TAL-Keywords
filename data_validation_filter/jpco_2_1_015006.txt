completeness of scattering states of the dirac hamiltonian with step potential the completeness together with the orthonormality of the eigenfunctions of the dirac hamiltonian with step potential is shown explicitly these eigenfunctions describe the scattering process of relativistic fermion off the step potential and the resolution of the identity in terms of them completeness is shown by explicitly summing them up where appropriate treatments of the momentum integrations are crucial the result would bring about basis on which field theoretical treatment for such system can be developed introduction in quantum mechanics physical observable is represented by self adjoint operator acting on hilbert space its eigenvalues are all real valued corresponding to its measured values in experiments and the eigenfunctions belonging to different eigenvalues are orthogonal to each other which is in accord with the physical situation that the two events with different outcomes are mutually exclusive and never happen simultaneously these statements are easily proved and the proofs are found in any textbook of quantum mechanics in which however we always find another statement accompanied claiming that the eigenfunctions form complete set the statement is physically sound because if we measure physical quantity in any state we would and should have result the obtained value of which is one of the eigenvalues of the corresponding operator and this implies that any state can be expanded in terms of the eigenfunctions even though we would all admit its necessity for physical ground the proof of completeness of eigenfunctions would not so easily be done once they constitute continuous spectrum this constitutes striking contrast to the case where only finite number of discrete states exist for in such case one can convince oneself that finite number of mutually independent vectors are enough to express any state thus the proof of their completeness is trivial when continuous spectrum is involved only exception where one can easily discuss and confirm the completeness of the eigenfunctions would be the free case in this case the plane waves the eigenfunctions of the free hamiltonian form complete orthonormal set in the sense which are essentially the inverse fourier transforms of dirac delta function or the resolution of the identity what is not trivial is to show these relations when the plane wave solutions are replaced with the scattering wave functions for stationary potential problem as matter of fact even though the asymptotic completeness of the scattering states is proved within the framework of formal scattering theory see and there exists classic review on the analytical properties of radial wave functions by newton the completeness of say the coulomb scattering wave functions is shown on the basis of newton method rather recently this is because the long range potentials were not covered by their treatments and to show it on the basis of newton method one has to evaluate rather involved integrals in the complex plane surprisingly enough the situation is not at all better for cases with simple potentials say the step or well potentials in one dimension in fact the proof of the completeness of one dimensional scattering wave functions off step potential appeared only in the late and mathematically more rigorous treatment for step and well potentials has to be waited until apparently these potentials do not satisfy some of the premises assumed for the general proofs and one has to work out such cases separately even though the potentials are very simple and considered rather elementary in this paper we shall demonstrate that the scattering wave functions of dirac hamiltonian for system with step potential form complete orthonormal set along the same line of thought as by summing up all of them though the completeness of them in the same system is already shown in in mathematically rigorous way it is still of interest and instructive to see explicitly that the eigenfunctions of an interacting dirac hamiltonian can replace the plane waves in to play the same role the procedure taken here is intuitive straightforward though much involved and in accord with what physicists would expect the paper is organized as follows after the introduction of basic ingredients for the free dirac hamiltonian in the next section the scattering wave functions of the dirac hamiltonian for the system with finite step potential responsible for an impulsive force at the origin are presented in section they are categorized into several cases depending on the boundary conditions if dirac fermion with positive or negative frequency is incident from the left or the right of the step potential and on the value of incident energy the completeness condition expressed in the coordinate space refers to two spatial points and since the potential takes different values at the left and the right of the potential it is examined for three different cases in section the orthogonality between the left incident and right incident wave functions is shown explicitly for particular case as an illustration in section the last section is devoted to summary and prospect solutions of free dirac equation for later convenience we first fix the notations and normalizations of four component spinors of the free dirac hamiltonian the stationary plane wave solutions for the free dirac hamiltonian are for positive frequency ep and for negative frequency ep where is the third pauli matrix the unit matrix and two component spinor note that since we will consider step potential we setup the axis at right angle with the boundary of the potential and the trivial dependence on the other coordinates and is suppressed from the beginning and is ignored completely the problem is essentially in one spatial dimension though the spinors live in four dimensional space time and have four components these spinors are normalized and form complete orthonormal set now if constant potential is added to the above hamiltonian in all space the corresponding plane wave solutions are eq for positive frequency eq and for negative relative to frequency eq notice that the frequency eq can be positive for small momenta even though it is to be associated with the spinor note also that the above explicit forms of spinors are not unique since is commutable with the above and and therefore zu can be used instead of scattering states scattering problem of dirac fermion with mass off step potential where is the heaviside step function is easily solved for simplicity and definiteness only those cases where the potential barrier is higher than are considered see figure the stationary solutions for the left and right incident scattering problems described by the total hamiltonian are given by the eigenstates of the hamiltonian and are characterized by their boundary conditions left incident or right incident and the range of value of their eigenvalue left incident cases fore ep eq and therefore the left incident wave function reads as with the reflection and transmission coefficients determined by the continuity condition at here and in the followings the dependence on the spin is and will be suppressed in the wave functions the continuity of the current defined as jz at reads as which expresses the conservation of the probability forv no oscillating solution exists for the region and we have im for and for with the reflection and transmission coefficients resulting in total reflection for the current in the region vanishes identically forv the solution in the region is expressed in terms of ep eq or with the continuity of current implies the conservation of probability recall that the ordinary conservation law of probability is satisfied but finite and non vanishing transmission probability survives even at the infinite potential limit this phenomenon is known as the klein tunneling notice that no left incident particle is allowed for for the eigenstates are given by the negative frequency solutions ep eq with the current continuity and the conservation of probability are the same as in right incident cases fore eq ep or and the right incident wave function is given by with the continuity of current and the conservation of probability read as observe that no right incident particle is allowed for forv eq ep or the solution may be written as with the continuity of current and the conservation of probability are the same as in form no oscillating solution exists for the region and we have im for and for with in this case all particles incident from the right are reflected for ep eq and we have with positive and with in this case the same current continuity relation and probability conservation as in follow orthonormality and completeness relation these eigenfunctions form complete orthonormal set first the orthogonality of the above scattering sates is due to the general argument for self adjoint hamiltonians that is the eigenfunctions belonging to different eigenvalues are orthogonal to each other two with different energies are orthogonal and normalized as where ep ep the factor representing the orthogonality in spin space is and will be suppressed but understood on the right hand side and where it is necessary similarly we should have where eq eq and since the last orthogonality relation is not derived from the above argument for both and can happen to belong to the same energy its validity has to be explicitly shown incidentally the fact that the above wave functions in the preceding section are properly normalized can be shown explicitly by calculating the left hand sides of and for each case however we may confirm it indirectly when they are shown to satisfy the completeness relation with the right factors the orthonormality conditions imply that the following form of completeness relation holds where the unit matrix in spinor space has been suppressed on the right hand side and we have introduced shorthand notations ep and eq the dependence of the eigenfunctions on the spin is suppressed as before even though the summation over spin is explicit here proof of the completeness relation momentum integrations as described in introduction though it is generally taken for granted that eigenfunctions of hamiltonian constitute complete orthonormal set which can be shown explicitly when it has only finite number of discrete eigenstates to prove it for hamiltonian endowed with continuous spectrum can be another nontrivial task in the present case we need to show that the left hand side of is diagonal in both the coordinate and spinor spaces which would make the proof more involved than the non relativistic cases since the step potential takes different values depending on the sign of the coordinate we need to consider three cases that is and separately to prove case when both and are negative on the left of the potential the left hand side of the completeness relation is explicitly written down as where it is understood that the summation over spin has to be taken though not explicitly written down and the subscripts and are used to distinguish quantities associated with the left incident case and the right incident case with the same energy it is to be noticed that the reflection amplitude for the left incident case can be expressed as for all by proper analytical continuation from large or ep similarly the transmission amplitude for the right incident case can be understood as proper analytic continuation of after the change of variables from to or when eq the above expression is simplified as where and the fact that is commutable with both spinors and has been used we have to pay due attention to the fact that even though not explicitly written the values of and therefore those of are different when it appears in association with the spinor or which of course applies also to and in the above this is the reason why apparently the same quantities have not been put together in the last but one line observe that there are terms of functions of the difference and the sum and they are apparently independent of each other first all terms that are functions of are collected to yield we note that the transmission probability for the right incident case pq tq is the same as that for the left incident case qp tp which can be explicitly shown by direct calculation stating that the reciprocal relation in quantum mechanics also holds in this case finally the conservation of probability rp qp tp greatly simplifies the above to reach where at the first equality the spin sum has explicitly been taken and the unit matrix is suppressed on the right most hand second the remaining terms that are functions of are shown to cancel to each other we understand that the contributions coming from the integral can be evaluated on the complex plane because the combination in the exponents is negative definite the reflection amplitude decays at least like for large assuring the convergence of the integrands at and the integrands have no singularities other than the several cuts on the real and imaginary axis the integrand proportional to eip can be evaluated on the negative imaginary axis while the other one proportional to ip is to be evaluated on the positive imaginary axis where in both cases on the negative imaginary axis we set and while on the positive imaginary axis we have for small is real number smaller than ep and the reflection amplitude associated with spinor is analytically continued as because the purely imaginary quantity ep has the same phase as that of on the imaginary axis for where is real number and located on the real axis similarly for the reflection amplitude associated with spinor we obtain all contributions coming from small on the imaginary axis are put together to yield the coefficient of spinor vanishes because where we have used the relations and with similarly the coefficient of spinor since in this case with also vanishes thus what is remained is the contributions arising from large where becomes purely imaginary first we note that the function gains the same phase as that of on the imaginary axis iand for from the direct calculations we understand that the reflection amplitude for spinor is replaced by the following complex numbers on the imaginary axis while for spinor observe that the following equalities hold the spinor parts for and are explicitly worked out after summing over spin degrees freedom to be where the relation and has been used showing explicitly that they are actually the same the remaining integrations over are now written as which vanishes owing to the above relations and this completes the proof of the completeness relation for case as in the previous case the left hand side of is explicitly written down where is defined when eq as eq change of variables or reduces this to the reciprocal relation qp tp pq tq also holds true in this case which can be proven by direct calculation and the probability conservation rq pq tq brings about the delta function from those terms that depend on the difference in the above the remaining integrations over are evaluated on the imaginary axis where spinors become and and the reflection amplitude for spinor is represented as and for and rq as the complex conjugates of the corresponding ones thus the contributions of terms that are functions of are which can be shown to vanish on the basis of the similar arguments as before this completes the proof for case if the left hand side of is explicitly written down in this case there are eight actually ten different terms existing corresponding to eight different cases and it can be shown however that these terms are categorized into four groups according to their energy eigenvalues ii iii and iv consider first the contributions arising from those wave functions that are belonging to eigenvalues energies greater than they are expressed as observe that in this energy range the reflection and transmission amplitudes are all real valued and moreover the following relations hold and thus the above expression is simplified to as matter of fact it can be confirmed that the contributions coming from the wave functions belonging to energy eigenvalues greater than or equal to are consistently written in this form with the lower limit replaced with when in order to make the integrand convergent at the first term in is defined by while the second term is defined as notice that here on the left hand side the variable is to be replaced with that specified at vertical bar or in the quantities which are considered as functions of while on the right hand side conjugate operations are to be taken for functions of specified variables for example and since in the second term of we analytically continue the term eq ep is replaced with iv ep in the amplitudes which results in the relation tp rptp this relation also holds when the sum of these two terms is just the contribution from the energy range in the energy range we note that ep ep and therefore the integrand in the parentheses in becomes nothing but which is the contribution from this energy range finally in the energy range the variable is positive number and appears in association with the spinor as iqz or eiqz which implies that the term has to be replaced with iv in the amplitude and with iv in tp in note that in either case is to be replaced with it is straightforward to confirm that the following relations hold for the left incident contribution and for the right incident contribution the second terms on the right hand sides of these relations those proportional to the product of reflection and transmission amplitudes are canceled to each other and finally we arrive at the conclusion that the contributions coming from the energy range are consistently written down as ii straightforward calculation yields where tqrq tq has been used in the first equality actually in the first term of the last line is evaluated by replacing ep by iv ep in the original one in and it is confirmed that it coincides with qtq under these replacements together with we can show that remember that under these replacements is to be replaced with and we get the right exponential factors similar argument is applied to the second term the contribution is now summarized as where the integration contours are taken along the imaginary axis iii and iv we first consider the region iv where the contribution coming from this energy range is since in the contribution arising from the region iii the relation tqrq tq holds we can rewrite this as furthermore we confirm that the transmission amplitude in this energy range is analytically continued for ep as so that the contribution coming from region iv is expressed as integrations along imaginary axis putting all contributions iv together we understand that the left hand side of is conveniently written as observe that the exponential factors make the integrands convergent at in the lower half and upper half planes for the first and second lines respectively if proper branches have been chosen for momentum since singularities only appear on the real and imaginary axises as branch cuts the integrals are evaluated on the imaginary axis from im to for the first integral and from to for the second remember that here we are considering the case where and we note however that the momentum for spinor ep and that for spinor ep are different quantities though expressed with the same symbol for notational simplicity and we have to choose proper phase when they are analytically continued actually if we put and thus ep iand on the imaginary axis we have for spinor which are different from those for spinor we will put together those terms that have the same dependence when analytically continued on the imaginary axis the first term and the last term in have the same dependence iq the first term is evaluated as while the last term as observe that the amplitude tp is actually the same quantity for both cases for after the spin sum the spinor parts are explicitly written down as and we carefully examine the phases of the square roots and understand that these two spinor parts have opposite signs and are canceled to each other this means that the first term and the last term in are canceled to give vanishing contribution similar argument shows that the remaining two terms the second and the third terms in cancel to each other and we can conclude that vanishes identically this completes the proof of for the case of where its right hand side vanishes to summarize cases complete the proof of completeness relation orthogonality between and as is already stated only non trivial relation is the orthogonality relation between and for definiteness the orthogonality shall be demonstrated here only for the case of in this case the inner product between and is explicitly calculated as again trivial factor arising from the spinor inner product shall be suppressed the second and the last terms contain terms proportional to delta functions which vanishes because of the relation tprqqp tqrp the remaining parts are collected to yield we note that ep ep and eq eq and furthermore substitution of these expressions into yields after straightforward calculation which is zero because eq ep and eq ep thus the right hand side of is shown to vanish which means that the wave function for left incident case and that for right incident case are orthogonal when the above argument would easily be extended to other energy ranges to show the orthogonality between and summary and prospect the scattering states of the dirac hamiltonian describing fermion dynamics under the step potential are shown to form complete set by directly evaluating the momentum integrals this indirectly justifies that they are properly normalized and they constitute an orthonormal set though it has been expected from physical ground to show that the scattering states that is the eigenstates of hamiltonian belonging to continuous eigenvalues form complete set when no bound states are allowed is not at all trivial and actually has required careful analysis on their analytic properties as expounded here in detail it may be stressed that in this relativistic case due attention has to be payed also on the spinors which has made this issue more involved than in the non relativistic cases we observe that irrelevant terms that do not contribute to the delta function and thus have to be canceled in the completeness relation are concisely expressed as or which would be reflection of the existence of more formal treatment in the relativistic case like in the non relativistic case the proof of the asymptotic completeness in is based on the fact that the scattering states of particular range of energies eigenvalues constitute projection operator on that energy range which is derived from the construction of the resolvent of the hamiltonian in terms of the scattering states the treatment is mathematically rigorous and elegant however it might seem bit technical for physically intuitive eyes the presentation here though rather involved and not elegant would be just what such people is looking for actually just as in for the non relativistic cases the integrations over momentum have been carried out straightforwardly and explicitly resulting in the delta function that represents the completeness relation it would be interesting and instructive to see how such an intuitive approach does work even for this relativistic case needless to say the present issue is closely related to the so called klein tunneling or klein paradox in this respect it is worth stressing that the oscillating solution of the dirac equation in the potential region when the left incident energy is below is given by negative relative to frequency solution tv iqz see this is the right solution that belongs to the correct eigenvalue eq and satisfies the correct boundary condition describing positive current jz qm corresponding to transmitted wave the correctness would also be justified by the fact that it is one of the correct elements of the complete set other choices would result in the violation of the very eigenvalue problem and or the boundary condition therefore as already stated in there is no anomaly in the conservation of probability even in this case but the transmission probability remains nonvanishing in the infinite potential limit which is known as the klein tunneling the complete orthonormal set obtained in this paper can be used as basis for further explorations of such system of fermion under the step potential within the framework of quantum field theory work in such direction is in progress and will be reported elsewhere
