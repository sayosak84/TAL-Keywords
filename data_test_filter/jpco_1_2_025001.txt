efficient antihydrogen detection in antimatter physics by deep learning antihydrogen is at the forefront of antimatter research at the cern antiproton decelerator experiments aiming to test the fundamental cpt symmetry and antigravity effects require the efficient detection of antihydrogen annihilation events which is performed using highly granular tracking detectors installed around an antimatter trap improving the efficiency of the antihydrogen annihilation detection plays central role in the final sensitivity of the experiments we propose deep learning as novel technique to analyze antihydrogen annihilation data and compare its performance with traditional track and vertex reconstruction method we report that the deep learning approach yields significant improvement tripling event coverage while simultaneously improving performance in terms of auc by introduction in recent years numerous experiments have successfully trapped or formed beam of antihydrogen atoms these experiments aim to test cpt symmetry by comparing the properties of the antihydrogen atom to those of the hydrogen atom or test the effects of gravity on antimatter antihydrogen is produced either by injecting antiproton and positron plasmas into cryogenic electro magnetic traps where three body recombination takes place or by the charge exchange processes between positronium antiproton and antihydrogen ps and ps in most cases antihydrogen production is detected by its annihilation signature whereby several charged pions are emitted from the annihilation vertex these are distinguished from cosmic or instrumental background events using the hit multiplicity and the inferred positions of the tracks and annihilation vertex previous experiments have detected trapped antimatter annihilation events using algorithms specifically developed for tracking and vertex finding predominantly adopted from high energy physics hep however antimatter trap experiments are not designed for high resolution and high efficiency tracking performance the necessary layers of vacuum chamber walls multi ring electrodes and thermal isolation limits the resolution of the detector and the effectiveness of these algorithms therefore the vertex reconstruction approach may not be optimal for detecting antihydrogen event signals in this setting we present machine learning approach for analyzing data from antimatter trap experiments that does not require explicit vertex reconstruction specifically we propose deep learning with artificial neural networks as strategy to identify antihydrogen annihilation signatures from low level detector data alone this approach has the advantage of being able to exploit subtle and previously unrecognized characteristics in the data as demonstrated in higgs search and higgs decay studies from hep we train our system using monte carlo simulated data to distinguish between antihydrogen like signal and antiproton background annihilation events and compare the performance to traditional track and vertex reconstruction method the specific use case presented in this paper is the asacusa antihydrogen experiment whose aim is to directly compare the ground state hyperfine transition frequency of hydrogen with that of antihydrogen test of the cpt invariance principle measurements of the antihydrogen hyperfine transition frequency are performed by measuring the rate of antihydrogen atom production in penning malmberg trap while controlling the antiproton injection conditions the overlap time while mixing antimatter plasmas and other key parameters which allow us to constrain the three body recombination yield and the level population evolution time of the formed antiatoms thus the sensitivity of the experiment depends directly on the efficient detection of antihydrogen annihilations other antihydrogen experiments face similar challenges although the background processes or event topology might be different classifying annihilations in cryogenic environment with significant material budget is common problem therefore advances in single annihilation event classification in asacusa could potentially lead to performance improvements in other experiments monte carlo simulation and annihilation event reconstruction the asacusa experiment traps charged particles antiprotons and positrons on the central axis using electro magnetic fields when neutral antihydrogen atom is produced predominately via three body recombination of antiprotons and positrons it may escape these trapping fields and annihilate on the inner wall of the trap emitting charged pions that can be detected however continuous annihilation of trapped antiprotons on residual gas atoms produces background annihilation events that emit the same pions the latter tend to be emitted from the central axis rather than the inner wall so we can distinguish between antihydrogen and antiproton events if the position of the annihilation can be inferred from the detector data the pions are detected by the asacusa micromegas tracker amt which consists of full cylinder layer of plastic trigger scintillator bars sandwiched in between two half cylinder curved micro strip pattern gaseous detector layers of micromegas technology in the typical vertex finding approach each trigger event is processed with track and vertex reconstruction algorithm proceeding as follows first the single detector channels are searched for entries above threshold and neighboring channels are iteratively clustered to form hits the detected hits are used to form and fit tracks using kalman filtering algorithm after fitting all hit pair combinations in an event the track candithe filtered track candifinally event classification is performed based on the radial distance of the reconstructed vertex closest to the central axis in order to test the ability of this algorithm to discriminate between signal and background annihilations monte carlo simulations were performed to produce event data that reflect the realistic conditions in the asacusa experiment the geant toolkit was used to simulate the antihydrogen and antiproton annihilation processes the trap environment and the amt the full material budget of the cryogenic vacuum trap was used in order accurately model the effects of multiple coulomb scattering on the emitted pions before they reached the surrounding detector micromegas single hit resolution was simulated with garfield magboltz and heed for the response of charged pions of mev momentum and was found to be much better hit than the amount of smearing of the pion track positions coul mm due to coulomb scattering when the pions reach the amt detector using the detected hits the reconstructed vertex position resolution was estimated to be vx cm the result of vertex reconstruction on the simulated data is illustrated in figure in the asacusa experiment tracking detector layers are only present in the upper half of the trap which is reflected in the distribution of reconstructed vertices the shape of the distribution also reflects the smearing of the position by cm due to the coulomb scattering of the charged pions in the trap material and the heavy overlap in the class conditional distributions of the radial distance for the experiments performed in section probabilistic classification of events is performed by simple neural network model with single input one hidden layer of hyperbolic tangent units and logistic output unit that predicts the probability that an event was an antihydrogen atom versus an antiproton deep learning approach we propose deep learning approach in which an artificial neural network is trained to classify annihilations directly from the raw detector data this automated end to end learning strategy can potentially identify discriminative information in the raw data that is typically discarded by the vertex reconstruction algorithm for example this approach will provide predictions for events on which vertex reconstruction fails such as when only single track can be reconstructed two design choices were made regarding the neural network architecture that first data from micro strips situated along the azimuth and axial dimensions are processed along separate pathways that are then merged by concatenating the hidden representations higher in the architecture second each pathway consists of alternating convolution and max pooling layers which repeat the same feature detectors via weight sharing and pool activity from adjacent neurons this design accounts for the translational invariances of the detector and reduces the total number of network parameters the raw detector data consists of binary values from the two detector layers and two micro strip orientations inner and outer azimuthal strips and inner and outer axial strips the inner and outer detector layers are treated as two associated channels where the outer azimuthal layer is downsampled with linear interpolation to match the dimensionality of the inner layer diagram of the network architecture is shown in figure results one million annihilation events of each because the detector only covers half of the trap many pions escaped undetected and the vertex finding vf algorithm failed on of these events did not result in any detector hits had hit in only one detector and had hits in both detectors but vertex could not be reconstructed vertex reconstruction failed because either there were not enough distinct hits to infer the presence of at least two tracks or the point of closest approach of the reconstructed tracks was greater than the threshold value of cm thus direct performance comparison was only possible on the of the test set events for which the vf algorithm succeeded even though the deep learning approach provides prediction for every event due to the complexity of the non neutral plasma physics and atomic scattering processes there is no physics model to our knowledge that would be able to predict the true axial distribution of the antihydrogen atoms in realistic experimental conditions in the future characterization of this distribution may lead to improved performance but for the present analysis we train the classifier in such way that the output is invariant to translations in the axial dimension this was achieved by augmenting the training data in which simulated antihydrogen annihilations occurred at cm see figure by randomly translating each event during training by pixels in the dimension where is sampled from the uniform distribution the same augmentation was used on the validation and test sets to evaluate performance but was the same on non augmented data indicating that the network learned invariant features the neural network was trained with variety of hyperparameter combinations in order to optimize generalization performance on the validation set these hyperparameters included the specifics of the network architecture shape the best architecture has five convolutional layers with kernel sizes the size of the receptive fields for neurons in each layer channel sizes the number of distinct feature detectors in each layer and rectified linear activation in order to account for translational invariance each convolution layer is followed by max pooling layer with pool size and stride length the flattened representations from the two pathways are then concatenated and followed by two fully connected layers of and rectified linear units then single logistic output unit with relative entropy loss during training dropout was used in the top two fully connected layers to reduce overfitting the model weights were initialized from scaled normal distribution as suggested by he et al then trained using the adam optimizer with mini batch uptraining was stopped when the validation objective did not improve within window of three epochs the models were implemented in and and trained on cluster of nvidia titan black processors performance comparisons were made by plotting the receiver operating characteristic curve and summarizing the discrimination by calculating the area under the curve auc figure shows that the deep neural network classifier outperforms the vf approach by large margin on the test events for which vertex could be reconstructed versus auc remarkably the deep neural network achieves auc on disjoint set of events for which vertex could not be reconstructed and auc on the union set containing all events for which both detector layers were hit not shown this effectively triples the event coverage to of all events while simultaneously improving the auc by more than these results clearly demonstrate that useful information contained in the raw data is being discarded by the vf algorithm and that the deep learning approach is able to use this information to improve discrimination additional experiments evaluated the advantage of deep learning compared to shallow machine learning with boosted decision trees and neural networks with only single hidden layer these experiments were performed on the non augmented data where the convolution and pooling layers provide less of an advantage for the dnn figure shows that xgboost and shallow neural networks both perform better than the vf algorithm using the raw detector data and auc on the same test events but not as well as the dnn auc the shallow network had hidden rectified linear units and was trained with dropout in the hidden layer and the adam optimizer the hidden layer size dropout probability and learning rate were optimized based on validation performance the xgboost classifier had trees with maximum depth of and minimum child weight of and was trained with regularization factor of and feature sampling rate conclusion in summary we report the first application of deep learning for the identification of antihydrogen annihilation events using realistic monte carlo simulations of both antihydrogen like signals and antiproton background events moreover we the results demonstrate significant performance improvements compared to track and vertex reconstruction approaches in scenario with limited detector resolution vertex reconstruction necessarily discards statistical information when fitting tracks and the approach fails completely on all but of events in our experiments with the deep learning approach an end to end neural network model extracts additional statistical information from the raw data improving auc from to on the same event subset it also has far better coverage achieving auc on the of events in which both detector layers were hit while we expect more modest performance gains in detectors with better resolution the deep learning approach proposed here can easily be deployed to other ongoing antimatter experiments with different instruments furthermore the ability to detect complex signals in high dimensional data without relying on explicit track reconstruction potentially offers new direction in the design of future detectors finally the data used in this paper comprising two million events are publicly
