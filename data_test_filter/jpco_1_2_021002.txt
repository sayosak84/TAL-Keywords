floquet topological magnons we introduce the concept of floquet topological magnons mechanism by which synthetic tunable dzyaloshinskii moriya interaction dmi can be generated in quantum magnets using circularly polarized electric laser field the resulting effect is that dirac magnons and nodal line magnons in two dimensional and three dimensional quantum magnets can be tuned to magnon chern insulators and weyl magnons respectively under circularly polarized laser field the floquet formalism also yields tunable intrinsic dmi in insulating quantum magnets without an inversion center we demonstrate that the floquet topological magnons possess finite thermal hall conductivity tunable by the laser field quantum magnets without an inversion center allow an intrinsic dzyaloshinskii moriya interaction dmi which is consequence of spin orbit coupling and it is usually fixed in different magnets the associated magnon bands in the magnetically ordered systems have nontrivial topology with chern number protected chiral magnon edge modes in two dimensional systems and magnon surface states in three dimensional systems they are dubbed topological magnon chern insulators and weyl magnons respectively they are the analogs of electronic topological chern insulators and weyl semimetals however due to the charge neutral property of magnons topological magnonic materials are believed to be potential canditopological magnonic materials magnon chern insulators and weyl magnons also possess thermal hall effect as predicted theoretically and observed experimentally to generally every quantum ferromagnetic material does not have strong intrinsic dmi necessary for topological magnons to exist for instance the single crystals of the ferromagnetic honeycomb compounds crx br cl and show no evidence of dmi and kagom haydeeite also does not have finite topological energy gap in the observed spin wave spectra suggesting that the dmi does not play significant role in haydeeite these ferromagnetic materials with negligible dmi are candiby applying circularly polarized laser field in these topologically trivial systems one can generate topological magnons magnon chern insulators and weyl magnons via tunable synthetic laser induced dmi this is particularly important as it offers way to tune the dmi in magnetic materials the floquet theory of laser driven systems provides theoretical as well as experimental method to engineer such topologically nontrivial systems this formalism is mostly dominated by electronic systems and also optical bosonic systems moreover an applied laser field provides means for coherent control of the magnetization in quantum magnets in this letter we introduce the floquet formalism to and ferromagnetic quantum magnets in the presence of circularly polarized electric laser field we show that the underlying charge neutral magnons acquire time dependent aharonov casher phase which generates tunable synthetic dmi in magnetic systems with negligible intrinsic dmi this leads to emergent nontrivial magnon chern insulators and weyl magnons with finite thermal hall conductivity which can be manipulated by the laser field our results provide novel platform to engineer topological magnons in topologically trivial insulating quantum magnets we hope that these results will extend the experimental search for topological magnons to broader class of insulating quantum magnetic materials even without an intrinsic dmi let us consider and ferromagnetic spin systems described by the pristine hamiltonian and where denotes summation over nearest neighbor nn sites and are the magnetic spin vectors at the lattice sites located at and is the ferromagnetic interaction for now we take the intrinsic dmi to be negligible which is the case in most ferromagnetic compounds therefore the goal is to generate synthetic dmi by periodic modulation of the lattice using time dependent electric field of laser light we are interested in the underlying magnon excitations of the quantum spin hamiltonian as described by the holstein primakoff transformation where are the bosonic creation annihilation operators and denote the spin creation and annihilation operators which correspond to the hopping terms however we will retain the spin operators in order to show the explicit form of the laser induced dmi as magnons are charge neutral bosonic quasi particles they do not interact with electromagnetic field except through their magnetic dipole moment which we assume to be in the direction where is the bohr magneton and the land factor now suppose that circularly polarized laser electromagnetic field with dominant electric field components cos sin is irradiated perpendicular to the magnetic material lying on the plane where for right and left circularly polarizations respectively the magnetic dipole moment of magnon quasi particles hopping in such an electric field background will acquire phase factor given by where sin cos is the vector potential with amplitude due to the electric field of the laser beam the phase factor can be regarded as the time dependent aharonov casher phase acquired by the hopping of charge neutral magnon quasi particles in the presence of time varying electric field the corresponding time dependent hamiltonian is given by and js noticing that the direction of the vector pointing from to defines relative angle we get sin and is absorbed in the floquet theory is standard mechanism to study driven quantum systems in the likes of equation it enables one to transform time dependent model into static effective model governed by what is called the floquet hamiltonian now we proceed with this formalism the static time independent effective hamiltonian can be expanded in the power series of and it is given by and eff and eff we calculate the series expansion of the effective hamiltonian using the discrete fourier component of the time dependent hamiltonian and and with period where and with and and and is the bessel function of order for and zero otherwise we have used the standard relation sin and mx in the high frequency limit the leading order contribution is the zeroth order effective hamiltonian given by and eff and where and eff js and and thus the zeroth order term yields an xxz ferromagnetic hamiltonian for quantum spin ferromagnetic systems equation is equivalent to the bose einstein condensation of hardcore bosons studied by matsubara and matsuda but in this case by lowering the frequency the first order contribution to the effective hamiltonian is non negligible it is given by and eff and and the commutator of the spin operators results in product of three spins reminiscent of the scalar spin chirality in order to see this we note that the component of the spins vanishes for therefore the commutation relation in the first order term involves only we use this relation together with the identity and and and obtain and eff where sin with and is the intermediate lattice site between and and the sum is over the triangular plaquettes of the chosen lattice geometry the main result of this letter is the induced synthetic dmi by circularly polarized laser field as given in equation the dmi points along the direction perpendicular to the plane on the kagom and pyrochlore lattices the synthetic dmi lies within the bonds of the nn sites whereas on the honeycomb lattice it lies within the bonds of the next nearest neighbor nnn sites the dmi is the primary source of magnon chern insulators and weyl magnons in insulating quantum ferromagnets consequently dirac magnons in ferromagnetic systems and nodal line magnons in ferromagnetic systems with negligible intrinsic dmi will be driven to magnon chern insulators and weyl magnons respectively by the circularly polarized laser field now we exemplify this method by utilizing the honeycomb ferromagnets for simplicity see figure in this case the relative angle is given by where for hopping within respectively hence the total effective floquet hamiltonian up to first order is given by and eff js where we note that so that the spins would prefer to order magnetically along the direction the synthetic dmi does not affect the ferromagnetic ordering of the spins we study the underlying magnon excitations of equation by implementing the linear order holstein primakoff transformation mentioned above on the two sublattices and of the honeycomb lattice in the bosonic representation the synthetic dmi is imaginary it generates synthetic magnetic gauge flux within the nnn sites the momentum space hamiltonian is given by and eff where are pauli matrices and is an identity matrix js and with cos sin and sin the floquet magnon bands are given by where labels the top and the bottom bands respectively henceforth we set the floquet magnon bands are depicted in figure for zeroth order and first order ii contributions to the effective hamiltonian in the former the system exhibits dirac magnon points but they are different from the dirac magnon points in the undriven systems because the floquet dirac magnons can be manipulated by anisotropic laser field amplitude in this case the dirac magnon points can move away from the high symmetry points of the brillouin zone at and can also be gapped out by fine tuning the anisotropic amplitudes however the system will still remain topologically trivial at the zeroth order as time reversal symmetry is preserved figure the schematic of the honeycomb lattice with laser field induced dmi the blue dotted and crossed circles denote the direction of the synthetic dm vectors pointing in and out of the lattice plane on the nnn bonds here are the vectors connecting the nn sites and connect the nnn sites the different colors of the solid circles red green are used to denote the two sublattices figure floquet magnon band structure of circularly laser driven honeycomb quantum ferromagnetic spin system for mev floquet dirac magnon in the zeroth order approximation ii floquet topological magnon in the first order approximation nontrivial band topology arises by lowering the frequency and the first order correction becomes important which breaks time reversal symmetry this leads to synthetic dmi which induces gap gap at the dirac points as shown in figure ii the floquet magnon bands now acquire nonzero berry curvature which has the form and where and is the berry connection and are the floquet eigenvectors of and eff the floquet chern numbers are given by the integration of the berry curvatures over the brillouin zone and bz it is easily shown that the floquet chern numbers are proportional to the synthetic dmi and sgn which can be controlled by the laser field the nontrivial topology of the floquet magnon bands has an important transport consequences it can lead to floquet thermal magnon hall effect this refers to the generation of transverse heat current upon the application of longitudinal temperature gradient in this case the synthetic laser field induced berry curvature due to the dmi appear in the equations of motion of magnon wave packet in the same mathematical structure as magnetic field in the lorentz force in other words the berry curvature due to the dmi acts like an effective magnetic field in momentum space on the magnons the resulting effect is the production of transverse thermal hall conductivity which can derived from linear response theory the floquet thermal hall conductivity is given by xy bz kc where is the bose function close to thermal equilibrium ln ln li and li is polylogarithm in figure we have shown the plots of xy as functions of the parameters in units of for the two band honeycomb ferromagnets the floquet thermal hall conductivity is negative and it is tunable by the amplitude frequency of the laser field in particular xy can be tuned off at the zeros of and this is usually not possible in materials with strong intrinsic dmi in the absence of laser field figure floquet tunable thermal hall conductivity xy versus for different temperatures ii xy versus for different amplitudes here mev and however applying circularly polarized laser field in magnetic materials with strong intrinsic dmi can induce tunable dmi using the simple honeycomb ferromagnetic model as an example the suitable dmi due to inversion symmetry breaking of the lattice is of the form and dmi where the summation is taken over the triangular plaquettes of the nnn sites in the presence of circularly polarized laser field with sufficiently high frequency the zeroth order correction to the effective hamiltonian gives and dmi eff and now the value of the intrinsic dmi can be manipulated by varying for gap exists at the dirac points and it closes near the first zero of the bessel function and reopens for consequently the sign of the chern numbers berry curvatures of the two bands changes as shown in figure hence sign change emerges in xy not shown we note that sign change is not possible in the undriven system on the honeycomb lattice the complete topological phase transition including trivial insulating regime with zero chern number can be found by including nnn heisenberg interaction as we have shown in the supplemental material see the supplemental material is available online at stacks iop org jpco mmedia figure evolution of sign change in the floquet chern numbers of honeycomb ferromagnets with tunable intrinsic dmi for different values of and the black lines are the magnon bulk bands and blue lines denote the chiral magnon edge modes gapless at as indicated by the dashed line it is important to note that the circularly polarized laser field is necessary to induce tunable synthetic dmi in quantum ferromagnets with negligible intrinsic dmi however in frustrated magnets with coplanar magnetic order static magnetic field applied perpendicular to the plane of the magnets can induce tunable synthetic scalar spin chirality due to non coplanar spin configurations in this case tunable topological magnons can be produced even in the absence of an intrinsic dmi in conclusion we have shown that the time dependent aharonov casher phase acquired by charge neutral magnons in time varying circularly polarized electric laser field induces synthetic dmi leading to nontrivial topological magnons in the absence of an intrinsic dmi therefore dirac magnons and nodal line magnons become magnon chern insulators and weyl magnons respectively under radiation our results also showed that the intrinsic dmi in insulating quantum magnets without an inversion symmetry can be manipulated with circularly polarized laser field hence the emergent thermal hall effect can be turned it is experimentally feasible to investigate the proposed phenomena in magnetic insulators using ultrafast terahertz spectroscopy this formalism may find application in the switching of magnetization and magnon spin current by laser field as an important step towards magnon spintronics and magnetic data storage we believe that these results will extend the study of topological magnons to different magnetic materials without any restrictions in an inhomogeneous static electric field time independent aharonov casher phase can be acquired by magnons and leads to magnonic landau levels in insulating magnets
