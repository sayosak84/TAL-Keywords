superconductivity in a two dimensional repulsive rashba gas at low electron density we study the superconducting instability and the resulting superconducting states in a two dimensional repulsive fermi gas with rashba spin orbit coupling at low electron density namely the fermi energy ef is lower than the energy er of the dirac point induced by rashba coupling we find that superconductivity is enhanced as the dimensionless fermi energy f f e f e r decreases due to two reasons first the density of states at f increases as f second the particle hole bubble becomes more anisotropic resulting in an increasing effective attraction the superconducting state is always in the total angular momentum j z or j z channel with chern number c or c breaking time reversal symmetry spontaneously although a putative leggett mode is expected due to the two gap nature of the superconductivity we find that it is always damped more importantly once a sufficiently large zeeman coupling is applied to the superconducting state the chern number can be tuned to be and majorana zero modes exist in the vortex cores despite an effect originating from relativity spin orbit coupling soc has found its way into nonrelativistic physics in condensed matter physics novel systems with soc playing a significant role are found recently such as topological insulators two dimensional d rashba gases at interfaces of oxides weyl semimetals and soc induced mott insulators and other states in d series while in ultracold quantum gases although atoms are neutral synthetic soc can be generated by atom light interaction see for review turning to superconductivity non centrosymmetric superconductors where soc mixes spin singlet and triplet pairings have been extensively studied and in d superconductivity related to soc was observed at oxide interfaces here we study a d repulsive gas with rashba soc at low density the single particle hamiltonian is h k m r and x d k n where m is the effective mass r characterizes the strength of rashba soc and x d s components are pauli matrices and n is the direction normal to the d system by a unitary transformation to helicity basis one finds the dispersion e k k k r m where is the helicity and k r m r is the rashba momentum we have shifted the energy by k r m which will be compensated by the shift of the fermi energy the spin degeneracy is lifted resulting in two bands touching at a dirac point in this system the competition between the three energy scales the fermi energy ef coulomb repulsion and the rashba energy e r k r m determines the system s phases we define the dimensionless fermi energy by f e f e r by low density we refer to the regime f as shown in figure a while in the low density limit the fermi energy is much smaller than coulomb interaction and soc energy and wigner crystalline phases are found we focus on the weak coupling limit un tot although n tot f as discussed below where u is the short range repulsion and ntot is the total density of states dos at fermi energy we investigate the instability of the system to superconducting states in earlier papers the high density case with f was studied it was found that as f decreases from a large value to in general superconductivity is enhanced and the total angular momentum channel jz in which cooper pairs condense decreases from a large value as an arithmetic sequence with a step of finally at f jz becomes the superconductivity predominantly resides on the outer fermi surface and interband coupling induces a small gap on the inner fermi surface the superconducting state breaks time reversal symmetry trs and both fermi surfaces are fully gapped figure a the dispersion relation fixing ky with the helicity labeled at low density the fermi level indicated by the dashed line is below the dirac point at energy er b the two fermi surfaces the annulus between which is filled by electrons with helicity the black arrows represent the direction of the spins around the fermi surfaces a topological change of the fermi surface occurs at f below which is the low density regime we are interested in as shown in figure b there is an electron like and a hole like fermi surface between which the annulus is filled by electrons the fermi wave vectors rescaled by kr are k f f where or corresponding to the outer and inner fermi surface respectively note that the two fermi surfaces have the same helicity the dos at the fermi surface is n f where m it is likely that superconductivity is further enhanced since the total dos increases with decreasing f as n tot f in addition we wonder what a topological change of the fermi surfaces may bring about to the dielectric functions which can give rise to the attraction in nonzero jz channels the enhancement of conventional superconductivity in attractive rashba gases at low density has been studied in while here we following the renormalization group rg approach developed in we find that at low density the superconducting instability always occurs in jz channel and the critical temperature tc increases with decreasing f the increasing could be of many orders of magnitude although the resulting tc is still quite low due to the weak coupling nature of our formalism a recent theme in condensed matter physics is to search for majorana fermions in various systems in addition to intrinsic chiral p wave superconductors spin orbit coupled systems such as topological insulators semiconductors with zeeman splitting in proximity to s wave superconductors and hole doped semiconductors also support majorana fermion modes in the vortex cores we show that the intrinsic superconducting state we have found can also host majorana fermions once a sufficiently large zeeman field is applied and the topological phase diagram is derived we also study the collective modes in the superconducting state due to the two gap nature in addition to the usual bogoliubov anderson goldstone bag mode which is pushed to plasma energy a collective mode corresponding to the oscillation of the phase difference of the two gaps the leggett mode could also exist however the values of the interband and intraband couplings in the whole parameter regime do not support an undamped leggett mode methods perturbative expansion and rg approach we study the system with onsite repulsive interactions the interacting hamiltonian of which is where u is positive the interacting hamiltonian in the helicity basis reads where ak is the annihilation operator in the helicity basis and k is the angle of k following the weak coupling rg approach developed in and integrating out high energy modes from the bandwidth a to a low energy cutoff we derive the effective action for the low energy modes where kbt and a s and a sup sup s are grassmann numbers we have focused on the cooper channel the couplings of which are the only marginally relevant ones and decomposed the couplings into angular momentum channels where k k since in j channel u dominates one cannot get attractive interactions therefore we go to higher orders and look for nonvanishing terms in higher angular momentum channels at second order we have particle hole bubble and particle particle bubble the latter of which only has j component the correction from the particle hole bubble shown in figure a is u k k k k where the dielectric function is where since cooper pairs are expected to form between electrons near the fermi surfaces k and k are restricted to be at fermi surface and respectively straightforward calculations show that k k can be written in the form where f cos is a real function that depends on the dimensionless fermi energy f but not on e and e independently then the renormalized coupling appearing in equation reads where v jz is the j th fourier component of s f cos f cos f cos the functions s f cos are plotted in figure at f s and s connect with the same functions at f calculated in but s changes sign due to the change of the helicity of the inner fermi surface clearly the functions depend more strongly on at smaller f up to the fourth order of u there is only one term that satisfies two conditions i being finite in nonzero angular momentum channel and ii having a logarithmic divergence ln a which may give rise to an instability this term is shown in figure b including it the renormalized couplings become defining the dimensionless bare coupling g jz u m n n v jz and the dimensionless renormalized coupling g r jz n n v r jz we find the rg flow equation where is the matrix multiplication and the bare couplings have been replaced by the renormalized couplings the solution is with the initial condition the scale of the superconducting transition temperature is given by the largest energy at which the renormalized coupling diverges where j is chosen in such a way that at a given f g jz is the most negative among all the g jz s we find that as long as f jz although it increases in general with f when f the intraband and intraband couplings are shown in figure the effective coupling g jz is plotted in figures and in units of u and u ntot respectively results effective couplings and critical temperature the critical temperature is given by where a is the bandwidth jz and g jz is the effective coupling in j channel given by where v jz and v jz are the intraband couplings on the outer and inner bands respectively and v jz is the interband coupling they are shown in figure in j channel as can be seen v and v are negligible above f and superconductivity predominantly resides on the outer fermi surface and the inner fermi surface participates only at quite low density the effective coupling g jz is plotted in figures and in units of u and u ntot respectively although it seems g jz can acquire any large value from figure in our weak coupling rg approach the result is not justified for untot and we see from figure that the effective coupling is still restricted to be small in the justifiable parameter regime however t can increase by many orders of magnitude as f decreases if u is fixed a superconductor insulator transition is expected as the density of the gas decreases since wigner crystal state should exist at strong coupling but we are not concerned with this case topological phase diagram with zeeman field as discussed in the ground state breaks trs spontaneously and the system goes to either j or jz superconducting state both of which have the same energy due to soc the paring term in the hamiltonian has both triplet and singlet part which reads where t and s are the triplet and singlet pairing strength respectively and k is the angle between k and k axis to search for majorana fermions instead of solving the bogoliubov de gennes equations in the presence of vortices we apply an index theorem proved in that superconductors with an odd chern number can support majorana zero modes in the chern number c of this state has been shown to be jz if ef er and if ef er to have an odd c we apply a zeeman field h which couples to the system as since now the hamiltonian breaks trs the two states with jz have different energies as pointed in if hz the system favors j state and if hz it favors jz state these two cases are related by time reversal operation so we just consider the former case we calculate the chern number and find three topological phases depending on the position of fermi level and h as shown in figure the topological phase diagram can be explained as follows when hz the dirac point is gapped and chern number is well defined for each band in the superconducting state due to the winding of spin around k the band with helicity carries chern number in addition the phase winding of the order parameter superimposes j to the chern number of each band therefore the inner and outer band carry chern number jz and jz respectively when ef er hz the fermi level crosses both bands and the chern number is the sum of the two c jz when ef er hz the fermi level either crosses the outer band twice in which case the electron pocket and hole pocket contribute opposite chern number thus c or does not cross any band and hence c between these two parameter regimes i e when hz ef er the fermi level only crosses the outer band and then c jz in this case according to the index theorem mentioned above majorana zero modes exist at the edge and in the vortex cores at low density only the left part of the phase diagram in figure b is available collective modes collective modes in superconductors were first studied by bogoliubov and anderson they found a goldstone mode accompanying the spontaneous breaking of u gauge symmetry in a neutral system which corresponds to the phase oscillations of the superconducting order parameter in a charged system this so called bag mode is pushed up to the plasma frequency in two band superconductors leggett predicted another collective mode corresponding to the oscillations of the relative phase of the two superconducting condensates in the superconducting state derived above due to the two gap nature in addition to bag mode leggett mode is also expected to exist the detailed calculations are carried out in the supplemental material effectively in j channel we have a two band p i p superconductor actually if the bare interaction were attractive superconductivity would occur in j channel and the superconducting state would also have a two band p i p nature thus our approach also applies to that case we find both bag and leggett modes while the former is pushed to plasma energy the latter has a dispersion where in the above n s are the dos g v and where n is the total particle number in band and labels the outer and inner band note that the second term in equation does not appear in a two band s wave superconductor in order for leggett mode to exist it is necessary for to be positive hence g g g however the whole parameter regime shown in figure does not satisfy this condition thus this mode must be damped in our model but in other soc superconductors leggett mode could exist discussion and conclusion looking for various ways to increase the critical temperature of superconductors is an important direction in condensed matter physics we showed that increasing rashba soc or decreasing the fermi energy can strongly enhance superconductivity in a d repulsive fermi gas in the low density regime as shown in figure if we assume un is fixed to be the effective attraction can be increased by ten times by decreasing f resulting in a much higher t than that in the high density regime although such superconductivity is still too weak to observe in our weak coupling approach we wonder if soc helps in strongly correlated systems which is worthy of further study in real materials the underlying lattice will affect the model in several aspects the dos is suppressed although increasing with lowering f it will not diverge the particle hole bubble will also be affected due to these two consequences the behavior of t will be modified but the trend that t increases with lowering f will probably remain the same moreover the spontaneous trs breaking state may not be stable unless the two pairing components of the j state d and dx y order parameter belong to the same irreducible representation of the point group which can be satisfied if the lattice has a threefold rotational symmetry in conclusion we have investigated the superconducting instability of a d rashba gas with repulsive interaction at low density in the weak coupling limit as the density decreases the superconducting transition temperature increases significantly the superconducting state is always in j channel when a zeeman field is applied the state can have an odd chern number and hence majorana zero modes are supported although leggett mode does not exist due to the specific parameters we expect it to appear in other spin orbit coupled superconductors because of the two gap nature
