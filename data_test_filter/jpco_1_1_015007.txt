bilinear biquadratic spin rings an su symmetric mps algorithm for periodic boundary conditions an efficient algorithm for su symmetric matrix product states with periodic boundary conditions is proposed and implemented it is applied to study of the spectrum and correlation properties of the spin bilinear biquadratic heisenberg model we characterize the various phases of this model by the lowest states of the spectrum with angular momentum for systems of up to spins furthermore we provide precision results for the dimerization correlator as well as the string correlator introduction about years ago the density matrix renormalization group dmrg emerged as precision tool for the numerical description of one dimensional quantum many body systems starting with it was applied successfully to many spin and strongly interacting electron systems later it was realized that dmrg can be reformulated in terms of matrix product states mpss comprehensive review of mps algorithms and their relation to dmrg is presented in in this review most algorithms are formulated without regard to symmetries such as or su however already stlund and rommer in an attempt to understand the success of dmrg used su symmetric mps they realized that the local matrices tensors decompose into structural part given by the symmetry and degeneracy part the structural part consists of clebsch gordan coefficient and the variational parameters of the model reside in the degeneracy part only the number of parameters to be determined is therefore significantly reduced with respect to non symmetric theory this approach first suggested by stlund and rommer was then generalized to higher order tensors in and then applied to mera tensor network calculations general relations between the symmetry of two body hamiltonians and the local symmetry structure of translational invariant mps and peps projected entangled pair states are studied in tensor networks with su and more general non abelian symmetry were investigated in in addition to the basic implementation of symmetry into tensor network with the purpose of reducing the number of independent parameters it is possible to entirely eliminate the structural tensors and develop algorithms in terms of the degeneracy tensors only this reduces the requirements for computational resources significantly and in turn enables significant improvements to the accuracy of the results that can be obtained the elimination of structural tensors from the algorithms requires changes to standard non symmetric tensor network implementations via precomputation schemes as suggested in it is the purpose of the present paper to develop an algorithm for su symmetric mps with periodic boundary conditions pbcs in terms of reduced tensors only we express symmetric tensors using the wigner eckart theorem in terms of reduced tensors degeneracy tensors and structural tensors consisting of products of clebsch gordan coefficients to this end we strictly follow the methods and conventions of edmonds we do not use the tree decompositions advocated in for the representation of symmetric tensors the linear maps relating different tree decompositions of symmetric tensors derived in directly correspond to expressions relating different coupling schemes in terms of racah wigner or more general symbols consequently the precomputations for the linear maps suggested in may be expressed in terms of such symbols furthermore we apply the proposed algorithm to physically rather complex one dimensional model the spin bilinear biquadratic heisenberg bbh model on ring with set to and sand the spin su matrix representations in moreover we will study the spectrum of the bbh hamiltonian for pbc and various which have not yet been this will shed some light on old questions concerning the phase structure to be discussed below the bbh model describes the behavior of atomic spinor condensates in optical lattices under certain conditions it also models the physics of some quasi one dimensional crystals in livge or ni no clo nenp furthermore it was extensively used as test bed for new tensor network algorithms however these algorithms do not explicitly implement su symmetry and the methods developed here and for infinite systems in could serve well to implement su symmetry into those approaches the continuous su symmetry of the bbh model cannot be broken due to the mermin wagner coleman theorem as consequence the eigenstates of this hamiltonian can be characterized by the total angular momentum quantum number due to the discrete translational symmetry the eigenstates can also be labeled by the quasi momentum quantum number however unlike su symmetry translational symmetry will not be built into our mps ansatz explicitly in the present paper the bbh model has other symmetries not explicitly built into the mps here su symmetry at and symmetry not easily uncovered in the spin representation of the model as function of the control parameter the infinite size spin bbh model exhibits the rich phase structure shown in figure we briefly discuss the various phases moving around the circle of the phase diagram in clockwise direction for the system is in the gapped haldane phase with hidden topological order the ground state has spin and is non degenerate the first excited state is triplet spin at the model corresponds to the simple heisenberg antiferromagnet and at arctan the ground state is the aklt state at the gap vanishes and there is second order phase transition to the dimerized phase the dimerized phase extends from to the ground state is doubly degenerate state with gap to either spin or spin excited state it shows non zero dimer order at the biquadratic model can be mapped to the spin xxz model and therefore it is exactly solvable using the bethe ansatz this point is characterized by very long ranged spin correlations and maximum nearest neighbor entanglement according to the dimer order parameter behaves non typically in the parameter region and quadrupolar spin correlations increase dramatically there the conjecture of chubukov that there is gapped nematic phase in this parameter region was debated in and rejected in based on the proposal of the dimerization close to was determined explicitly in numerically the existence of the nematic gapless phase in the narrow vicinity of is not yet ruled out since the values to be calculated are comparable with the precision of the numerical calculations in that parameter region in the region the system is in gapless ferromagnetic phase with multi fold degenerate ground state at the critical point the system exhibits su symmetry the ferromagnetic phase is followed by gapless phase with dominating quadrupolar spin correlations for at the lai sutherland point the system undergoes kosterlitz thouless phase transition into the haldane phase at the lai sutherland critical point the system shows su symmetry and is exactly solvable by the bethe ansatz see using the proposed su symmetric mps algorithm for pbc we calculate energy spectra and characteristic correlation functions in different phases of spin ring at selected parameter values the calculated energy gaps between these states enable already an elucidation of the phase structure from finite system results in particular the existence of fifth nematic phase can be for the haldane phase we calculate the string correlator of the ground state and in the dimerized phase the dimerization from the lowest two states these two states form degenerate doublet in the thermodynamic limit the paper is organized as follows in section we briefly review the mps formalism for pbcs which is based on the algorithm proposed by verstraete et al in section this algorithm is rewritten using su symmetric tensors only as already emphasized it is an objective of the present paper to eliminate all structural tensors from the pbc algorithm this is more complicated than for obc since higher order tensors must be considered these technical developments are relegated to several appendices which form an important part of the present article and should enable straightforward implementation of the algorithm as consequence we only need to handle the degeneracy parts of the tensors explicitly this enables significant improvements to the efficiency of the implementation in fact the mps virtual dimensions we are able to use are much larger than in various recently proposed implementations for pbc without su symmetry we provide the reduced mpo representation for the bilinear biquadratic spin hamiltonian as well as the corresponding reduced representation for sup sup and other operators this enables the calculation of the variance of the various eigen energies we apply the proposed su symmetric algorithm to the bilinear biquadratic spin heisenberg model in section and discuss the low lying spectrum in all phases except the ferromagnetic phase we also briefly the results of our work are summarized in section review the mps formalism for pbc an mps formalism for pbc was originally proposed in and extended in we summarized the algorithm in and therefore we only briefly review here those aspects which are relevant for the present discussion the state of quantum many body system of size is approximated in terms of matrix product state here the represent the local degrees of freedom at site the local hilbert space is assumed to be finite dimensional and its basis is enumerated by the the elements mai ai of the rank tensors are the parameters characterizing particular state for periodic systems we set an and the dimension of the bond indices is set to analogously operators are written as matrix product operators each is rank tensor wii ii with in the bond indices of operators have dimension and the operators studied in the present work can be expressed exactly in terms of tensors with small bond dimension matrix elements of mpo in mps can be expressed in terms of the rank generalized transfer tensor ew with the tensor elements the matrices and characterize the states and respectively the special transfer tensor represents the matrix element of the identity operator with note that we chose to write the algorithm in terms of higher rank tensors in order to ease the implementation of su symmetry in the next section parentheses are used to group indices conveniently in order no minimize the energy variationally due to pbc one has to solve at each upthe elements of these matrices are obtained from the blocks hl nl and hr nr are contractions of the transfer tensors and as defined in equation to the left or to the right of the site respectively in order to define what is left and right we initially label the sites from to and keep this labeling throughout the calculation all sites with label smaller than are left of site and all sites with label larger than are right of site contraction of block with transfer tensor is depicted in figure the block and transfer tensors are kept rank throughout the algorithm we assume summation over repeated indices however for clarity we sometimes write out the summations explicitly brackets are used in order to indicate fusion of several indices into combined single index the upthe value eventually converges to the ground state energy during the iterative upthe upthe algorithm presented above not only allows the variational determination of ground states but also the calculation of excited states they can be constructed by finding the lowest state in the sub space orthogonal to the space spanned by the states already found in order to implement corresponding upi the local mps tensor must not only minimize the effective hamiltonian but must also be constructed in such way that the mps of new excited state to be calculated is orthogonal to all mps already calculated before for all here enumerates these states for the ground state for the first excited state etc we denote the tensors of the states by and the tensors of the new excited state by then the local projection operator must fulfill the condition with matrix of row vectors obtained from the condition for all the projection matrix is determined by an orthogonalization of the matrix the rank block tensors ol and or are the contractions of all transfer tensors to the left or right of site respectively again summation over repeated indices is assumed in equation su symmetric mps algorithm for pbc we now introduce su symmetry into the formalism presented above we assume an su symmetric hamiltonian and su symmetric states the symmetry is not broken this holds in due to the mermin wagner coleman theorem technically all tensor indices can then be chosen to be su invariants they decompose into total spin angular momentum index spin projection index as well as degeneracy index which counts the number of times specific su representation occurs ms for the physical indices of mps we have however the spins in the bond indices are highly degenerate in practice we only need moderate degeneracies for our calculations first we briefly introduce su symmetric mps and discuss the construction of states with given total angular momentum we eliminate all structural tensors from the algorithm in section as well as several appendices construction of su symmetric mpss for pbc first we discuss how to construct su invariant states states with total spin the set of mps matrices defined in equation must be brought into an su symmetric form at every site the structure of the rank local tensor at position is determined by the wigner eckart theorem according to which the tensor decomposes into degeneracy part and and structural part with the structural part fixed by su symmetry and given in terms of the wigner symbol the degeneracy part also often called reduced tensor is denoted by script letter while the corresponding full tensor is denoted by roman letter here for simplicity we omit the position index this index will be reintroduced whenever necessary it is often convenient to use combined index and jt and the degeneracy part and does not depend on the spin projections and contains the variational parameters of the state note that the reduced matrix elements of the mps for which the spins do not fulfill the triangle rule can be set to zero as the corresponding symbol vanishes under these conditions this makes the reduced mps matrices rather sparse in fact they have banded block structure we will call the set of all jt which characterize reduced matrix its degeneracy set in practice we want to choose the smallest possible set with few different spins and small degeneracies however it must be noted that at present we have no method in order to choose this set algorithmically of course for large system we expect that the required degeneracies will be large on the other hand the size of the degeneracy sets is strictly limited by the available computing resources we will discuss this issue further in the following sections we now turn to the construction of covariant states with total spin to achieve this fictitious non interacting local spin is inserted into the system the fictitious spin is inserted at the site between site and site the tensor at this additional site takes the form and the resulting mps has total spin for completeness we define after optimization of the tensor network with the fictitious spin one needs to obtain the covariant state jm which is given by this state must be normalized if required in practice we seldom need to reconstruct the state using equation since the calculation of su invariant observables can be expressed in terms of the reduced tensors only as is shown further down in this section the optimization algorithm for su symmetric mps for pbc in order to make best use of the symmetry it is advantageous to introduce reduced tensor structure not only for the mps but for all other tensors of the algorithm as well this enables to express the whole algorithm in terms of degeneracy tensors only and spin projection indices and the structural parts of the mps will be completely eliminated from the algorithm as consequence the computations are significantly more efficient and calculations with much larger virtual dimensions become feasible in the present section we will explain how the pbc algorithm presented in section is rewritten in terms of reduced tensors only technical details will be relegated to several appendices the results contained in these appendices will enable rather straightforward implementation of the proposed algorithm for open boundary conditions similar strategy was followed by mcculloch but not described in much detail however for pbc we face number of differences in particular the block tensors the products of transfer tensors are rank tensors for pbc while they are rank in the obc implementation in the following we will provide the general definition of reduced tensors and exemplify the construction of reduced tensors for rank tensors which are the building blocks of mpo we then go on to describe the variational algorithm for the determination of mps in terms of reduced tensors in order to introduce rank su invariant tensors ta ak each index has to be decomposed into spin index degeneracy index and spin projection index mj in the same way we did for the tensor indices of mps tensors in equation for an element of su invariant rank tensor may be obtained from the generalized wigner eckart theorem where ek are intermediate indices to be summed over and je jek ak is reduced matrix element while qja ja jakje jek is rank intertwiner of su generalized clebsch gordan coefficient obviously the tensor of an mps is special case of for there are no intermediate indices and the index decomposes trivially as ms or simply ms rank intertwiner may be decomposed into product of factors defined in equation different decompositions are possible and they may be represented as different coupling schemes as explained in more detail in here we will choose coupling schemes which we find convenient for our purposes let us illustrate the construction of su invariant tensors using an mpo tensor as example such tensors have rank therefore we need one intermediate index je me the mpo has two physical indices ms and ms assuming that at each site there are particles with the same spin and two virtual indices jtm the tensor is then decomposed as with rank reduced tensor and je the factor is introduced for convenience in order to free the reduced unity tensor from an dependence our definition of the reduced tensor corresponds to the coupling scheme shown in figure we note that te because fusion of two equal spins gives non degenerate spin due to the restrictions imposed by the structural factors as well as the high sparseness of the mpo in its full form many reduced tensor elements can be chosen to be zero and the reduced tensor and assumes characteristic sparse structure this is demonstrated by the reduced tensor representations of the hamiltonians needed in the present paper given in appendix we also provide reduced representation for the sup sup operator in appendix as was already stated the tensors of many important operators can be obtained exactly as well as their reduced tensor representation and this representation is characterized by degeneracy set jn tn for the bbh hamiltonian one finds as is shown in appendix similarly one can expand higher rank tensors like the block tensors and into reduced tensors details are given in appendix as consequence the optimization upthe updetails of the derivation of the optimization step in terms of reduced tensors are given in appendix reduced form of the projection operator defined in equation is also given there this enables the calculations of excited states in different spin sectors the regauging step equation in terms of reduced tensors is briefly described in appendix first demonstration that the proposed algorithm works as expected is given in appendix calculation of observables if the operator of an observable is su invariant its expectation value equation can be calculated using reduced tensors only in the present paper we do not consider covariant operators using equation for the operator and equation for the wavefunction jm one can write the expectation values of the su invariant operator are equal for different spin projections jm jm jm jm therefore we can write if the mps tensor at the fictitious site is normalized such that qr for simplicity we did not label the mps matrices with their corresponding local spin index in the last line we have represented the expectation value as reduced left block tensor as defined in appendix it is this represenation which we use for recursive calculation of expectation values using the formulas provided in appendix an example of an su invariant operator is the dimerization operator on the other hand the string correlator is not su symmetric due to the parity factor exp sjz for such operators full mps needs to be reconstructed using and the mpo in its full form must be used bilinear biquadratic spin heisenberg model with pbcs in this section we present numerical study of the spin bbh model equation this model has been studied extensively in recent years and we have given number of pointers to the literature in the introduction the present study is distinguished by its particular treatment of su symmetry in periodic systems with moderate computational effort and relatively small numbers of variational parameters we obtain results of high precision we present results for the low lying spectrum of the bbh model as well as for selected correlation functions in order to do calculations using the proposed algorithm one needs to choose an appropriate degeneracy set for the virtual spins the larger this set the larger is the computational effort an algorithmic procedure for automatic selection of suitable degeneracy set is presently under development in order to select the degeneracy sets we cautiously use one entanglement measure for initial guidance obviously for highly entangled states one needs large degeneracy sets with many virtual spins in order to estimate the entanglement of the states at different we use exact diagonalization for system of spins and determine the negativity of the ground state to quantify nearest neighbor qutrit qutrit entanglement see figure the negativity is obtained from the reduced qutrit density matrix where denotes the partial transpose of with respect to the first qutrit and the trace norm it is obvious from figure that bipartite entanglement is largest in the dimerized phase while in the haldane phase and the critical phase the states are less strongly bipartite entangled therefore we cautiously expect that the largest computational resources will be needed in the dimerized phase at the aklt point arctan there is local entanglement minimum at this point we just need the trivial virtual spin representation for quasi exact calculation for any system size the bi partite entanglement vanishes at the point which happens even for large systems at the negativity vanishes as well however at this point the ground state is in fact highly entangled it resembles state similar to the greenberger horne zeilinger state which in fact is maximally entangled our choice for the virtual spin representations and their degeneracies is partly guided by these entanglement results the negativity shows characteristic singularities at various points foreshadowing clearly already for the phase structure one observes in the thermodynamic limit interestingly there is weak singularity at the heisenberg point where there is no phase transition in the thermodynamic limit together with the bipartite entanglement we also plot in figure the quantity is the total spin of the ground state for in the parameter region of the critical phase while it is zero in all other phases except the ferromagnetic phase the mpss we construct are eigenstates of the bbh hamiltonian as well as eigenstates of the total angular momentum operator therefore we label the states with angular momentum however they are not necessarily eigenstates of quasi momentum operator as well nevertheless if the constructed eigenstates are non degenerate apart from the su degeneracies we determine in some cases the quasi momentum of the constructed states and label the states and their energies with the momentum label the operator of the translation over sites acts on an eigenstate with well defined momentum as therefore for such states np np can be determined from the expectation value of the translation operator tn ipn which is easily calculated in the mps framework using equation and cyclic shift of the mps tensors in ground state energy figure shows results for the ground state energies per site in the and sectors for spins as function of the parameter the global ground state the lowest state of all spin sectors is except in the critical phase where the global ground state is for and the ferromagnetic region due to the symmetry the minimal and maximal eigen energies are related by emin emax this maximal energy is also shown in figure with few exceptions we used the representation in order to produce this plot note that results for are rather close to the thermodynamic limit at exact ground state energies per site are known from bethe ansatz calculations we compare with these results in table and find rather good agreement it is interesting that our numerical results are obtained using half integer virtual spins only we obtain similar values with integer virtual spins however at somewhat larger numerical cost precise calculations are most resource intensive for the two su symmetric points and in particular virtual spins are necessary in the degeneracy set in the vicinity of in the ferromagnetic region the bilinear biquadratic spin heisenberg model has degenerate spin ground state for any system size it is possible to work out the ground state energy analytically within the proposed mps algorithm as the virtual spin configuration is simply we demonstrate this in appendix low lying spectrum while it is possible to extract much information on the phase structure from an analysis of the ground state properties in the present paper we will concentrate on the low lying excitation spectrum and we will discuss the spectrum at selected points in the phase diagram we will emphasize characteristic differences of the low lying spectrum in different phases which show up already for finite systems the spectrum for system of sites within the range is presented in figure we include the lowest two spin states one or two spin states and one spin state the states are labeled by their momentum in some cases we discuss the spectra in the various phases shown in figure from right to left characteristically in the critical phase the ground state for spins is doubly degenerate spin there is small gap to the lowest spin state and there are slightly larger gaps to two lowest spin states consequently the lowest excitation is expected to be quadrupolar in this phase which confirms predictions for spin chains in our numerical results for the ground state for the systems with or sites at agree quantitatively very well with predictions in obtained by extrapolation of the results for relatively small systems the ground state in the entire haldane phase is and the lowest excited state is the gap between these two states remains finite in the thermodynamic limit haldane gap numerical data for the state and state for purely bi linear heisenberg ring with sites are given in table from these results one obtains the haldane gap as compared to given in at the given precision cannot be distinguished from infinite systems the calculated energy of the state agrees well with the results from previous studies the data presented in figure refer to sites it is observed that at the first excited state in the spin sector lies much above the lowest spin state and it is nearly degenerate with the lowest spin state see also the dimerized phase has been the subject of many investigations in the history of the bbh model and we will this phase is characterized by the fact that the first excited spin state is lower than the lowest spin and spin states the spin state is lower than the spin state for but above this state for at the lowest spin and spin states form degenerate pair see also in the thermodynamic limit the two lowest states are degenerate however with finite gap to the lowest or states as shown in table the calculated energies of the three lowest states at the biquadratic point agree very well with the bethe ansatz calculations of rensen and young according to the heuristic entanglement analysis presented in the introduction to this section we expect calculations to be rather hard at this point and indeed we need large degeneracy sets in order to achieve reasonable precision in the parameter region of the debated nematic phase close to pbc rings of sites were investigated in we extend this work for systems of up to sites we observe that the lowest spin state is significantly lower than the first excited spin state as well as the lowest spin state as consequence quadrupolar correlations increase strongly in this region as pointed out in one may be tempted to conjecture the existence of the separate phase in this region from our results however in order to do so one must study the behavior of the spectrum in the thermodynamic limit which we do using finite size scaling analysis for the gaps and the conjecture of about the existence of the gapped nematic phase and was rejected in earlier works in fact these calculations suggest that however there exists still the possibility that in narrow region of earlier dmrg calculations for obc were not able to resolve extremely small values of from finite size scaling analysis we obtain at this suggests that the gap between the two lowest spin states closes in agreement with earlier calculations in fact can be fitted very well by power law bn in line with this the dimerization remains finite as discussed in more detail in the following subsection in contrast shows exponential behavior from fit to our data we obtain gap between the lowest spin and the spin states of size at moreover we observe monotonic decrease of the scaled gap and monotonic increase of the scaled gap with increasing of which also indicates the absence of nematic state at this however as pointed out in the possibility of the existence of such state even closer to cannot be excluded calculations closer to the ferromagnetic region for larger systems are presently under way correlation functions finally we also calculate few physically interesting correlations in the bbh model in the area we determine the dimerization correlator shown for system of sites in figure in fact due to translational symmetry the ground state as well as the excited states of finite size pbc ring are not dimerized in order to calculate the dimerization we take symmetric antisymmetric superposition of the lowest two states with different momenta these two states are separated by very small gap for finite systems and they should develop into the degenerate doublet in the thermodynamic limit the dimer order parameter calculated in this way is the dimerization can be calculated analytically for in the thermodynamic limit where the bbh model can be mapped to spin xxz model according to tanh narccosh which agrees with the monte carlo result of we fitted our results for and sites at by function given in equation of the fit gives in good agreement with the theory and calculations for larger systems about sites are needed to obtain more precise result the dimer order parameter was calculated in for finite chains of up to sites in such obc calculations there is no translational symmetry and the degenerate doublet is mixed automatically for systems of up to sites the results for pbc are always slightly larger than for obc there are also calculations of the dimerization for spin rings in however for the four point correlator our extrapolated result for is consistent with the result of finally we come back again to the haldane phase this phase is characterized by the presence of non zero string correlator of the ground spin state that does not decay in the limit figure shows the string correlator as function of the system size is and the string length is taken as this choice allows sufficient length of both the string and the rest of the system in order to resemble the infinite system properties numerical results indicate that is constant to high degree for our results in the range agree quantitatively very well with infinite size calculations presented in our numerical calculations indicate that long ranged string order is present in the haldane phase only however it is numerically hard to obtain precise values at the boundaries of the haldane phase the string correlator for the aklt point arctan can be calculated exactly which is reproduced extremely well in our calculation for sites the curve has the maximum at this point the best estimate for string correlator for the bilinear heisenberg spin model is our result calculated for system size of spins agrees very well with this value conclusions in the present work we developed an algorithm for su symmetric mpss with pbcs that involves only reduced tensor elements it was applied to study of the lowest lying states of the spectrum of the spin bbh model of up to sites the characteristic differences of the spectrum in the various phases of the model were stressed dimerization and string order were studied in the dimerized and haldane phase respectively our results agree rather well with previous studies based on dmrg or bethe ansatz calculations and we could extend previous studies to more complete coverage of the full parameter range in particular in the dimerized phase close to the transition to the ferromagnetic phase we confirm the absence of nematic phase for within our numerical precision the precision of the results we can achieve with our implementation of the algorithm depends on the degeneracy set we choose for the representation of the virtual spin indices of the mps due to fact that we have eliminated all spin projection indices our algorithm achieves rather large effective virtual spin dimensions in comparison to non symmetric implementation state with reduced mps dimension described by the degeneracy set corresponds to an effective mps virtual dimension which is already rather large for pbc calculation moreover due to the sparse structure of each mps reduced tensor such state is described by only complex parameters per site compared to complex parameters per site necessary to specify non symmetric state the number of parameters is also roughly one order smaller than for symmetric state for this state about of the parameters used in non symmetric calculation are actually zero due to symmetry as consequence the numerical effort for the solution of the generalized eigenvalue problem at each upin fact we suspect that the states determined without explicit consideration of the symmetry are incorrect even though their energy is determined precisely this needs to be investigated in more detail in future work of course the numerical effort to be expected grows with the size of the chosen degeneracy set and at this stage this set is fixed from the start of our calculation it would be desirable that the algorithm dynamically chooses this set according to suitable algorithmic criteria the implementation of such procedure is under way using ideas presented in and discussed for pbc in
