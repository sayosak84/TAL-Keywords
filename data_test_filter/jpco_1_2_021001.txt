magnetic order in laser irradiated kagome antiferromagnets dispersionless zero energy mode is one of the hallmarks of frustrated kagom antiferromagnets kafms it points to extensive classically degenerate ground states the zero energy mode can be observed experimentally when lifted to a flat mode at finite energy by a strong intrinsic magnetic anisotropy in this letter we study the effects of irradiation of laser light on the kafms we adopt the magnon picture without loss of generality it is shown that circularly or linearly polarized light lifts the zero energy mode stabilizes magnetic order and induces energy gaps in the kafms we find that the circularly polarized light induced anisotropies have similar features as the intrinsic in plane and out of plane dzyaloshinskii moriya interaction in kafms the former stabilizes long range magnetic order and the latter induces spin canting out of plane with nonzero scalar spin chirality the floquet thermal hall effect shows that the synthetic magnetic excitation modes in the case of circularly polarized light are topological whereas those of linearly polarized light are not geometrically frustrated kafms have been an intensively active field of research due to their exotic properties such as the possibility of quantum spin liquids qsls states where spin frustration forbids long range magnetic order down to the lowest temperatures classically the ideal heisenberg kafms have an extensive ground state degeneracy resulting in a zero energy mode a signature that no classical ground state configuration is favoured however order by disorder phenomenon is believed to lift the extensive classically degenerate ground states and selects a specific magnetic order usually the q spin configuration in which three spins on the triangular plaquette of the kagom lattice are oriented at apart another possibility of lifting the extensive classically degenerate ground states is by adding further neighbouring interactions moreover the geometry of the kagom lattice lacks an inversion centre and by the moriya s rules a dzyaloshinskii moriya interaction dmi is allowed the out of plane dmi is capable of inducing long range magnetic order in the frustrated kafms hence the zero energy mode can be observed experimentally as a flat mode with finite energy in realistic quantum kagom materials however further neighbouring interactions can be perturbatively small and negligible therefore the out of plane dmi is usually the dominant anisotropy in real materials nevertheless magnetic order in quantum spin kafms appears beyond a certain quantum critical point qcp of the out of plane dmi d z j below the qcp it is believed that qsl persists for instance herbertsmithite zncu oh cl has dominant out of plane dmi just below the qcp d z j and thus remains a qsl the kagom calcium chromium oxide ca cr o has also been proposed as a qsl material and there is no evidence of a strong dmi in the current study we shall consider an alternative source of inducing magnetic order in frustrated kafms the approach will be based on irradiation of laser light on the magnetic insulators this approach has attracted considerable attention as a possible mechanism to engineer synthetic topological systems in this letter we formulate the theory of laser irradiated kafms based on the holstein primakoff magnon picture however the basic idea can also be extended to charge neutral bosonic spinons in a similar fashion the main results of this letter are as follows first we show that circularly or linearly polarized laser light is capable of lifting the zero energy mode in the kafms thereby inducing magnetic order the associated magnetic excitation modes exhibit gaps at various points in the brillouin zone by inspection of measured spin waves in iron jarosites we are able to conclude that the circularly polarized laser induced symmetry breaking interactions possess distinctive features that are similar to the effects of intrinsic in plane and out of plane dmi on kagom magnetic insulators by studying the floquet bloch thermal hall effect close to thermal equilibrium we further establish that the magnetic excitation modes in circularly polarized light are topological whereas those of linearly polarized light are not these results suggest that laser irradiation can be considered as one of the possible ways to induce magnetic order and nontrivial topological magnetic excitation modes in kafms second we apply the theory of laser irradiation to kafms with an intrinsic out of plane dmi the results show that radiation can also tune the out of plane dmi in kafms and induce a possible synthetic noncoplanar spin configuration with nonzero scalar spin chirality let us consider the simple hamiltonian for frustrated kafms which is given by and x e j ij s i s j and x e ani where s i are the spin magnetic moments at the lattice sites i located at r i and j is an antiferromagnetic interaction between nearest neighbour sites here and x e ani is a small perturbative anisotropy to the heisenberg exchange term which is dominated by the out of plane dmi given by and x e ani ij d ij s i s j where d ij d z z is an intrinsic out of plane dm component due to inversion symmetry breaking on the kagom lattice at the midpoint connecting two magnetic sites and the sign alternates between the triangular plaquettes of the kagom lattice as shown in figure figure a schematic of the kagom lattice with out of plane dmi dotted and crossed circles and a coplanar q spin configuration arrows we also show the mirror reflection symmetry and x e y about the y axis and and x e and x e x about the x axis the primitive vectors are a a and a a a b first brillouin zone of the kagom lattice with indicated paths in the absence of the out of plane dmi the classical ground states of the ideal heisenberg klafm i e first term in equation are the q spin configurations shown in figure however they are infinitely degenerate a direct application of linear spin wave approximation about this classical spin configurations leads to a zero energy mode which points to the fact that no particular ground state spin configuration is favoured application of a static zeeman magnetic field partially lifts the degeneracy but does not remove it entirely in the quantum limit this would imply that the system is disordered in the later sections we will consider the possibility of lifting the zero energy mode and inducing magnetic order by laser irradiation as previously shown the out of plane dmi induces and stabilizes the q classical spin configurations the sign of the out of plane dmi determines which vector chirality of this long range magnetic order is selected in this letter we consider the positive vector chirality d z with the minus sign this form of the out of plane dmi respects the symmetries of the kagom lattice in figure in particular the combination of time reversal symmetry trs and x e and mirror reflection symmetry and x e i e and x e and x e x and x e or and x e y and x e is a good symmetry of the coplanar q spin configuration therefore we expect the underlying magnetic excitations to be protected by this symmetry and there should be a possibility of dirac point in the brillouin zone as we will show later irradiation by laser light will modify this spin structure the concept of laser driven magnetic insulators rely on the magnetic dipole moments of the underlying magnetic excitations as recently introduced in quantum ferromagnets this is due to the fact that charge neutral bosonic quasi particles do not interact with an electromagnetic field except through their magnetic dipole moment therefore this concept applies to both magnons and spinons we take the magnetic dipole moment to be along the in plane ordering direction and x d g b y where b is the bohr magneton and g is the spin g factor now we suppose that an in plane laser light with dominant electric field components e t is irradiated on the kagom lattice in the background of the time varying electric field the hopping of charge neutral bosonic quasi particles will lead to a time dependent aharonov casher phase which is given by ij t g b r i r j a t d where a t a sin t sin t is the vector potential with amplitude a due to the electric field e t c a t t note that circularly polarized laser light corresponds to and linearly polarization corresponds to or in the following we take the units c g b next we perform the standard spin wave analysis of the coplanar noncollinear spin configuration on the kagom lattice the basic procedure follows by rotating the coordinate axis about the z axis by the spin orientation angles and x e e z i cos i sin i sin i cos i where i hence the spin transforms as s i and x e e z i s i next we implement the holstein primakoff transformation s i y s a i a i s i s a i s i where s s x i s z and a i a i are the bosonic creation annihilation operators the corresponding time dependent magnon tight binding hamiltonian is given by and x e t js ij g ij a i a i a j a j g ij a i a j e i ij t h c g ij a i a j e i ij t h c where g ij d j g ij d j g ij d j and d j d z j note that the hopping terms have now acquired a time dependent phase by virtue of the peierls substitution in the momentum space we have and x e t k k and x e k t k where k a k a k a k a k a k a k is the basis vector and x e k t js and x e d and x e d t and x e d t and x e d t and x e d and x e d t where and x e d d j i and x e d t d j t and and x e d t d j t t cos k a t a cos k a t a cos k a t a cos k a t a cos k a t a cos k a t a note that equations and have off diagonal terms which do not exist in ferromagnets however the general formalism of floquet theory applies to any time dependent tight binding hamiltonian the basic idea of floquet theory is to transform a time dependent hamiltonian such as equation or into an effective static hamiltonian to proceed we write the floquet bloch wave function that obey time dependent schr dinger equation as k t e i k t k t where k t k t t is a periodic function that denotes the floquet bloch states for band with period t and k t is the quasi energy the periodic function can be expanded in fourier space k t m e i m t k m we define the floquet hamiltonian operator as and x e k f t and x e k t i t then the states k m leads to a time independent floquet energy eigenvalue equation m and x e k n m m n m k m k k n where and x e k t t d t e i t and x e k t the floquet formalism is reliable in the high frequency limit j therefore we work in this limit and consider the truncation at this juncture the floquet hamiltonian contains the zeroth order bessel function and x e and the first order bessel function and x e where depends on the amplitude a and phase however the resulting hamiltonian is a big matrix comprising numerous floquet bloch side bands therefore analytical analysis is unfeasible we therefore resort to numerical analysis we first consider the limit of zero out of plane dmi d z j in this case a zero energy mode is inevitable in figure we have shown the floquet bloch magnon bands in the presence of linearly a and circularly b polarized light for d z j and a along the brillouin zone paths in figure in both cases it is evident that the zero energy mode is lifted to nearly flat mode at nonzero energy we also observe that all the bands have a finite energy gap at the point as well as the k point it is believed that circularly polarized laser light breaks trs but it is very crucial to identify the form of the symmetry breaking interaction induced by the laser light interestingly the magnon bands in figure b for circularly polarized light exhibit all the important features reported in kagom iron jarosites they include gapped magnetic excitations at various points in the brillouin zone which were theoretically identified as a consequence of the out of plane and in plane intrinsic dmis therefore we infer that in the driven kafms circularly polarized light induces synthetic out of plane and in plane dmis the former is responsible for the stability of the coplanar q spin configuration leading to lifted zero energy mode as shown in figure whereas the latter which points inside the triangular plaquettes breaks mirror reflection symmetry and rotational invariance and it is responsible for spin canting out of plane and leads to a non coplanar umbrella spin configuration with nonzero scalar spin chirality the in plane dmi is the primary source of the energy gaps at the and k points therefore we conclude that irradiation by laser light can induce long range magnetic order in highly frustrated magnets in the same way as the intrinsic dmis as we will discuss in the following the laser induced anisotropy in the case of linearly polarized light figure a does not break trs figure top figure floquet bloch magnon bands of frustrated kafm for d z j a linearly polarized light b circularly polarized light here j a bottom figure floquet bloch magnon bands of frustrated kafm for d z j c undriven system the circled point is a dirac magnon node d laser driven system by circularly polarized light with j next we consider the limit of nonzero out of plane dmi d z j as shown in figure c the intrinsic out of plane dmi lifts the zero energy mode in the undriven system and stabilizes the conventional coplanar q spin configuration with a dirac magnon node at the k point protected by the effective trs and x e and x e y we can also see a gapless goldstone mode at the point due to u rotational invariance as the laser drive is tuned on this effective trs is bound to be broken and the dirac magnon node will be lifted as shown in figure d the presence of energy gap at the point also suggests that the induced synthetic anisotropy is an in plane dm component which obviously breaks rotational invariance and modifies the conventional q spin configuration as previously mentioned now we would like to compute an experimentally observable quantity in dm models on the kagom lattice the gapped excitations at the k point suggests that the floquet bloch magnon bands will be topologically nontrivial with finite berry curvature the effects of topologically nontrivial magnetic excitations are believed to manifest in the study of thermal hall effect recently the study of thermal hall effect of charge neutral bosonic quasi particles has attracted a lot of interest in ferromagnets and spin liquid magnetic insulators in the former the theory of berry curvature induced by the dmi can explain the observed thermal hall conductivity in the latter however the origin of thermal hall conductivity remains an open question but the scalar spin chirality could play a vital role in the current study synthetic trs breaking interactions are induced by circularly polarized laser light and they are identified as the in plane and out of plane dmi thus the theory of thermal hall effect can be applied in a similar way however the floquet theory leads to nonequilibrium distribution of the quasi particles and the bose function n b k will depend on the detail properties of the system in the following we focus on the case in which the bose function is close to thermal equilibrium and write the linear response thermal hall conductivity as xy k b t bz d k n c n k where n n b k e k k b t is the bose function close to thermal equilibrium c x x ln x x ln x li x and li n x is a polylogarithm the berry curvature is given by k and x e k z where and x e k i k k is the berry connection we note that k vanishes in the undriven system with only out of plane dmi due to an effective trs and hence xy is zero for laser driven system by circularly polarized light the chern number defined as the integration of the berry curvature over the brillouin zone is proportional to the synthetic scalar chirality of the noncoplanar spin configurations induced by the synthetic in plane dmi a nonzero thermal hall conductivity implies that the underlying magnetic excitations are topologically nontrivial in figure we have confirmed that indeed the magnetic excitations are topologically nontrivial in the case of circularly polarized light with nonzero xy for d z j a and d z j b furthermore we have checked numerically that xy vanishes for linearly polarized light or an indication that the laser induced anisotropy in this case does not break trs figure floquet thermal hall conductivity versus temperature for circularly polarized light and two laser amplitudes with j in summary we have shown that the dispersionless zero energy mode in frustrated kafms can be lifted by laser irradiation and long range magnetic order can be induced the possible circularly polarized laser induced synthetic interactions are identified as the in plane and out of plane dmis which play the same role in frustrated kafms with low crystal symmetry in the present case however their strength can be tuned by the laser light we also showed that the system possessed transport properties that can be experimentally accessible we believe that these results are within experimental reach and can be accessible with the current terahertz frequency using ultrafast terahertz spectroscopy thus far induced magnetic order in frustrated magnets is limited to applying an external magnetic field or pressure however these methods usually do not lead to an induced in plane and out of plane dmi therefore experiments can now look for how laser irradiation modifies the properties of frustrated magnets most importantly the laser induced topological magnetic excitation should be the primary motive as it quantifies the effects of laser irradiation on the system then thermal hall effect can be measured by applying a temperature gradient currently a lifted zero energy mode has only been seen clearly in iron jarosite but there are numerous frustrated kagom antiferromagnets therefore another experimental task would be the possibility of inducing lifted zero energy mode by laser irradiation on frustrated kagom antiferromagnets such as herbertsmithite zncu oh cl which is a known kagom antiferromagnet with qsl properties in the future it would be interesting to extend the current approach to spinons by the schwinger boson formalism
