metal backed fr dielectric is designed this structure has full width half maximum bandwidth of ghz and exhibits polarization independent jpcocharacteristics it also shows good absorption characteristics for incident angles up to for te and tm polarized wave further enhancement in bandwidth up to ghz is achieved by arranging the structures with overlapping resonances as a array this array is used as the unit cell for the larger array this structure also exhibits polarization independent characteristics and good angular stability up to the values of effective permittivity and permeability are retrieved from the reflection and transmission parameters of the structure these parameters also valithe performance of the fabricated structure for different polarization and angle of incidence is measured and the results are in good agreement with simulation finally the use of this structure to reduce the rcs of a patch antenna is demonstrated introduction in recent years researchers have found many interesting application of artificially engineered characteristics of metamaterials high impedance surfaces his are metamaterials exhibiting artificial magnetic conductor amc and surface wave suppression property at the resonance frequency his consist of an array of patches over metal backed dielectric amc exhibits varying reflection phase from to crossing at a single frequency at this resonance frequency it exhibits very high impedance and the incident electromagnetic wave is reflected back without any phase reversal due to this characteristic they are usually referred as perfect magnetic conductor which is the dual of perfect electric conductor pec the bandwidth of operation is defined as the frequency range in which the structure shows reflection phase variation from to because in this range the phase values do not cause any destructive interference between the direct and reflected wave due to this in phase reflection property his have found applications in low profile antenna design fabry perot cavity antennas radar cross section rcs reduction etc his are also employed to reduce the mutual coupling in antenna arrays due its surface wave suppression property his on a lossy dielectric behaves as perfect absorber rcs measures the detectability of target when illuminated by an electromagnetic wave the common methods used for rcs reduction are by absorbing the incident wave using radar absorbing material ram or by redirecting the scattered wave away from the observer holloway et al reported the reflection and transmission properties of metafilm in which it is proposed that the transmission and reflection properties can be controlled by changing the electric and magnetic polarizability his which consists of an array of frequency selective surfaces fss over grounded dielectric layer is a good candithe narrowband absorbers designed by exploiting the dielectric loss of his layer are referred to as perfect metamaterial absorbers first perfect metamaterial absorber consisting of electric ring resonator err and cut wire was proposed by landy et al in the electromagnetic power confined within the metmaterial due to the independently tuned electric and magnetic resonances by err and cut wire can be gradually dissipated due to the dielectric and ohmic losses of the structure and can result in perfect absorption metamaterial absorbers are characterized by light weight low profile and flexibility several planar dual band multiband variable band polarization independent and angularly stable matamaterial absorbers were reported till conformal absorbers made up of thin substrates working in microwave terahertz and infrared frequency regimes were also studied widely by researchers several techniques are introduced in literature to overcome the disadvantage of narrow bandwidth of these high permeability magnetic material are used instead of electrical substrate to enhance the bandwidth but this configuration results in increased weight similar resonators with different dimensions on multiple dielectric layers are stacked to achieve enhancement in bandwidth the main drawback of this configuration is increase in dielectric thickness in another technique multiple resonating structures with closer resonant frequencies are arranged close to each other to enhance the bandwidth in this paper an ultrathin metamaterial absorber with enhanced bandwidth and angular stability is designed and its application in rcs reduction of antenna is discussed the structure consist of an array of unconnected square loop and unconnected printed cross on a metal backed fr substrate it gives a full width half maximum fwhm bandwidth of ghz when the same geometrical structures with different dimensions are used in the array fwhm bandwidth is enhanced to ghz the effective medium parameters such as effective permittivity and permeability are retrieved using effective medium theory to investigate the absorption mechanism of the proposed structure it is observed that the retrieved parameters well explains the absorption mechanism the protothe characteristics remain within tolerable limits at different polarization of the incident wave at different angles of incidence design of the proposed structure design of the wideband element basic unit cell of the wideband element is shown in figure the structure is composed of two wideband printed fss elements arranged as shown unconnected rectangular loop and unconnected printed cross inside this loop the structure is backed by a grounded lossy fr dielectric j with thickness mm when a plane wave is incident on this structure it will reflect or absorb the power depending on the mismatch in impedance to that of the free space the reflection coefficient s of this structure is frequency dependent as given by equation where z and are impedance of the structure and free space at angular frequency respectively using the electromagnetic absorption theory the absorptance a is related to reflectance s and transmittance s as given by since this structure is backed by copper laminate transmission will be zero s and hence at the resonance frequency the impedance of the structure zs matches to that of free space impedance and the reflected power s becomes zero this will result in maximum absorptivity a the reflection coefficient of the structure is obtained by simulating the unit cell of the structure with appropriate boundary conditions using frequency domain solver in cst microwave studio under normal incidence the structure exhibits two absorption peaks of and at ghz and ghz respectively as shown in figure a the smith chart is shown in figure b it indicates that at ghz the real part of impedance is nearly equal to free space impedance and the imaginary part is negligible and it results in nearly absorption at ghz the real part of impedance is greater than that of free space and it has also imaginary component which results in reduction in absorption the bandwidth of operation is specified in terms of fwhm which can be expressed as where f and f are upper and lower frequencies at which of absorption is occurring here fwhm bandwidth observed is ghz from to ghz to get an insight to the resonating nature of the structure the surface current distributions at these peak absorption frequencies are plotted in figure from figures a and b it is evident that the printed cross is responsible for the absorption peak at ghz and the loop is contributing for the absorption at ghz these closely spaced resonance frequencies results in bandwidth enhancement due to the electric resonance phenomenon the surface currents are strong along the direction of electric field on the top metallic surface the surface current on the bottom metallic plate is in opposite direction as that of top surface and will form circulating loop around the magnetic field resulting in magnetic resonance as shown in figures a d the top metallic geometry and thickness of the dielectric substrate are the important parameters for the excitation of strong electromagnetic resonance which will result in maximum absorption figure shows the absorptivity calculated at normal incidence for the incident wave at different polarizations the angular stability of the structure is also studied and it is observed that the performance is almost stable for the incident angle ranging from to as shown in figures a and b modified structure for bandwidth enhancement the elements designed for different resonance frequencies are arranged as a array to form the single unit cell as shown in figure for the new wideband array the cells and are identical with cells and respectively the absorption peaks of cell and cell are overlapping so that the combined response is as shown in figure a the absorption peaks are observed at and ghz with absorptivity of and the fwhm bandwidth is increased to ghz ghz the impedance at resonance frequencies are depicted by smith chart as in figure b it indicates that when the real part of the impedance of the structure is equal to free space and the imaginary part has zero value it will result in maximum absorption the impedance mismatch between the structure and free space results in reflection and thus a reduction in absorption the absorption mechanism of the structure is due to the strong electromagnetic resonances at the absorption frequecies as explained in the above section the effective medium theory approach can also be used to investigate the absorption mechanism the reflection and transmission parameter of the structure are utilized to calculate the effective parameters of the structure it is considered that the substrate and fss elements are equivalent to an isotropic and homogeneous effective medium since the structure is backed by the ground plane there will not be any transmission and the effective parameters cannot be computed directly small perforations or cuts are made on the ground plane of the unit cell to obtain finite s the cuts are very small and have neglible effect on s the ground plane of the structure with cuts is shown in figure the simulated response of the structure with metal ground plane and perforated ground plane is shown in table it is noted that the frequency of absorption is slightly changed by perforation but the absorptivity is not much affected when a plane wave is incident on the structure the normalized input impedance z and effective refractive index n are related to thickness of the substrate h free space wave vector k and s parameters as the effective electromagnetic parameters of the medium such as effective permittivity and permeability can be calculated as at perfect absorption frequencies the impedance of the strcuture matches to that of free space and the real and imaginary part of normalized input impedance will be and respectively this will results in matching of real and imaginary parts of effective permittivity to that of permability values the real and imaginary part of extracted effective permittivity and permeability values are depicted in figures a and b respectively the enlarged view of the plot in the absorption frequency range is given in inset these parameters can be used to describe the absorption mechansim of the structure at ghz the imaginary part of effective permittivty and and permeability are same but the real parts have great difference resulting in reduction in absorption at ghz the difference in real part of permittivity and permeability is less and the imaginary parts are matching resulting in improvement in absorption at ghz the real part of permittivty and permeabilty are matching and the difference in imaginary parts are neglible which will results in further improvement in absorption the polarization sensitivity of the structure is also studied and is shown in figure the structure is showing absorptivity of more than for all the polarization angles with negligible change in fwhm bandwidth the angular stability of the structure is also studied for te and tm polarizations and depicted in figures a and b the structure exhibits its angular stability up to with fwhm of ghz the absorptivity is gradually decreasing with increase in incident angle the performance of the structure on lossless dielectric tan is depicted in figure the structure reflects all the incident power and the phase response is showing amc characteristics this proves that dielectric loss is the main factor contributing for the absorption performance the characteristics of proposed absorber is compared with previously reported absorbers and is shown in table it indicates that even though the unit cell dimension of the proposed structure is greater than half the wavelength of operation it provides maximum fwhm bandwidth with optimum thickness as compared to other proposed works results and discussion the proposed structure consisting of unit cells is fabricated on a mm mm fr sheet having thickness mm the photograph of the fabricated structure and the enlarged view of unit cell is given in figure the reflection from the structure is measured using two wideband horn antennas as transmitter and receiver as shown in figure the measurement is carried out in an anechoic environment using vna r and amp s zvb initially the reflected power from the identical sized metal plate is measured as reference for the normalization of scattering and diffraction losses then the reflected power from the structure is measured and the calculated absorptivity is depicted in figure the peak absorptions are observed at ghz ghz and ghz with absorptivity and respectively the measured fwhm bandwidth is ghz from to ghz the variation between measurement and simulation results can be accounted for change in permittivity of commercially available substrate or fabrication tolerance the polarization sensitivity of the structure is measured by rotating the horn antennas along the axis with a step size of and the result is depicted in figure the structure exhibits good absorptivity for all the polarization angles and the results are in good agreement with the simulation the fwhm bandwidth also remains unchanged the angular stability of the structure is also measured for different angles of incidence obtained by moving the tx and rx horn antennas around the structure the incident angle is varied from to and the figure shows that the structure exhibits good absorptivity for the incident angles up to it is observed that there is a degradation in absorption performance for the incident angles above these results also agree well with simulation these the target includes vehicles buildings etc usually antennas are placed over these the use of periodic structures like fss and metamaterial absorbers for the rcs reduction of antenna without compromising its characteristics is an area of major interest by several researchers here the use of this absorber for the rcs reduction of a patch antenna is studied an antenna with dimension mm mm is designed on a grounded fr dielectric having thickness mm to resonate at ghz the coaxial probe feed position is selected as mm away from the center for proper matching the antenna is surrounded by absorbing array as shown in figure some spacing mm mm between antenna and the absorber is given for the proper arrangement the effect of absorber on the antenna response is shown in figure the reflected power from the antenna surrounded by absorber is very less as compared to that of antenna with pec ground plane due to the absorption characteristics of the structure conclusion an ultrathin mematerial absorber with enhanced bandwidth and angular stability is proposed in this article the unit cell consists of a array of wideband absorber elements on a grounded fr dielectric substrate having thickness mm the structure exhibits three peak absorptions of and at ghz ghz and ghz respectively and results in wide bandwidth it exhibits good polarization insensitivity and angular stability up to the effective medium parameters are retrieved to investigate the absorption mechanism and it is observed that these parameters also valia protofurther enhancement of bandwidth can be made by increasing the number of elements in array such that these elements have overlapping resonance frequencies the application of this proposed structure in rcs reduction of antennas is also valiit is verified that the performance of the antenna is not degraded and reflected power from the antenna with absorber is less than db as compared to the antenna with pec ground plane
