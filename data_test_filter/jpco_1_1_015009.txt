wavelength scaling of high harmonic generation for nm nm and nm driving laser pulses we convert optical frequencies to the extreme ultraviolet xuv via high harmonic generation we compare the high harmonic conversion efficiency from three different driving wavelengths of and nm finding that the efficiency scales as where is the driving laser wavelength we find that the higher conversion efficiency and the increased free spectral range between harmonic orders are benefits of shorter driving wavelength as an xuv source we use these xuv sources to measure the photoelectron spectra of several atomic and molecular species introduction high harmonic generation hhg is nonlinear process that converts an optical laser field to the extreme ultraviolet xuv in most cases the xuv spectrum is series of odd harmonics of the fundamental frequency the harmonic spacing is twice the frequency of the fundamental this coherent xuv source has been used in femtochemistry attosecond science precision frequency comb spectroscopy and diffractive imaging the maximum generated harmonic energy is determined by the hhg scaling law of ip up where is the ionization potential of the generating medium and up is the ponderomotive energy related to the laser intensity and central wavelength however this increase in maximum generated photon energy comes at the cost of xuv flux it was shown theoretically and experimentally that the conversion efficiency to the xuv scales as for driving laser wavelengths of therefore it would appear that using shorter driving wavelength will result in higher conversion efficiency some work has been done on the high harmonic yield and the ellipticity dependence of nm harmonics from millimeter thick gas targets we will experimentally measure the conversion efficiency for shorter wavelengths of and nm from thick pulsed gas jet we will also show that using shorter driving laser wavelengths for hhg gives an excellent source of narrowband xuv frequencies suitable for applications such as photoelectron spectroscopy of atoms and molecules the premier source of such radiation is from synchrotron facilities which provide bright sources of tunable radiation synchrotrons are large facilities and they offer only limited time resolution hhg sources have the advantage of being tabletop devices and offer femtosecond time resolution in pump probe configurations current time resolved photoelectron spectroscopy experiments involve visible or uv pump pulse to excite the molecule followed by delayed uv pulse to photoionize the system the photoelectron kinetic energy spectrum as function of pump probe delay gives insight into the molecular dynamics the probe must have sufficient photon energy to ionize the molecule as typical nonlinear optical crystals absorb light below nm it is often necessary to use multiphoton ionization for probing this means that intermediate resonances can influence the measurement hhg sources have been used as the photoionizing probe but the harmonic orders are only separated by ev for nm lasers leading to overlap of features in the photoelectron spectrum to solve this problem time compensated monochromators can be used to isolate single harmonic out of comb of nm odd harmonics we will show that hhg driven by uv laser gives bright harmonic lines that are widely separated by ev for nm laser wavelength removing the requirement for monochromator experimental setup laser pulses from commercial ti sapphire laser system fs mj nm hz were sent into hhg chamber in first experiment the nm pulses were focused by cm focal length concave mirror into the gas jet emanating from the mm diameter nozzle of pulsed gas valve loaded with bar backing pressure of argon in second experiment mm thick bbo was used to generate nm pulses dichroic mirrors were employed to remove the fundamental light the second harmonic pulses were then focused by cm focal length concave mirror on the same gas target in third experiment mm thick calcite plate was used as time compensator after mm thick bbo crystal half wave plate at nm zero wave at nm was used to make the polarizations of the fundamental and of the second harmonic parallel before sum frequency generation inside mm thick bbo crystal the third harmonic pulse nm was focused into the gas jet by cm focal length aluminum coated concave mirror the polarization of the fundamental was adjusted to obtain horizontally polarized harmonics in each case xuv light generated in the gas jet was then sent through differential pumping tube into second chamber where the driving laser light was removed by nm thick aluminum foil the transmitted xuv radiation was then focused by gold coated toroidal mirror at incidence into either velocity map imaging vmi electron spectrometer or field free time of flight electron spectrometer in each case the input laser intensity was fine tuned by adjusting an iris before the input window the gas jet position was also adjusted in three dimensions to optimize the conversion efficiency the pulse energy was recorded at the optimal harmonic yield conditions these conditions are as follow mj at nm mj at nm and mj at nm results and discussion photoelectron spectroscopy we first demonstrate qualitatively how photoelectron spectroscopy benefits from short wavelength driven harmonics the harmonics were focused at the input of time of flight electron spectrometer the photoelectrons emitted in narrow cone along the polarization direction passed through skimmer into the cm drift region they were detected by micro channel plate equipped with conical anode detector the time of flight signal was digitized by counting electronics with ghz resolution all results are plotted in figure the photoelectron spectrum is best resolved with the fifth harmonic of nm figure where labels are indicating the ground state and the first two excited states of few comments are in order first the free spectral range between adjacent odd harmonics is equal to twice the driving laser frequency hence the separation between adjacent harmonic orders is ev in the nm case ev in the nm case and ev in the nm case the different electronic states are better separated in the photoelectron spectrum with and nm driving pulses where the greater free spectral range is clearly an advantage for molecular spectroscopy second since this spectrometer has fairly good energy resolution instr mev at ev instr mev at ev we can extract individual harmonic bandwidth from these spectra the vibrational progression of the state offers the best opportunity for fit each peak is spaced by ev the peaks from to have comparable amplitudes and in the case of nm driving laser the state does not suffer from spectral overlap between adjacent odd harmonics orders unlike and the intrinsic vibrational linewidth broadened by spin orbit coupling and rotational branching is about mev fwhm at room temperature assuming gaussian linewidth for all source of broadenings as fair approximation the deconvoluted harmonic linewidth is laser fit instr lineshape results are reported in table however note that we did optimize laser parameters for high harmonic yield and not for spectral narrowness simply put the individual harmonic bandwidth depends on the chirp of the driving laser pulse but also on essentially all laser parameters on the choice of the gas target and on the sub femtosecond ionization plasma dynamics during harmonic generation pulse durations estimates were derived taking into account the fourier transform limited spectrum of the driving laser and dispersion in the input chamber window anecdotally we achieved ev fwhm bandwidth for the seventh harmonic of nm when generating harmonics in but with lower photon flux photoelectron spectra of several gas species were also taken under similar conditions using the vmi detector few spectra are presented in figure for systems with simple photoelectronic spectra such as argon and neon the singly ionized atoms are left in the ground state of the ion which are ar sup sup ne sup sup sup sup sup sup and and ne sup sup he sup sup sup sup sup sup and the two spin orbit states are not resolved in these cases nm harmonics provide nicely multiplexed and non overlapping spectra from which useful information can be extracted such as relative cross sections and laboratory frame photoelectron angular distributions in the case of molecules such as and co the photoelectron spectra are more complex as they typically present several electronic states plus vibrational and rotational progressions not resolved here in the nitrogen spectrum is left in one of the three states and in carbon dioxide co is left in either or accidental overlap between different states from adjacent harmonics of nm presents problem the large free spectral range for and nm solves this problem in addition the brighter xuv speeds up data acquisition each vmi image shown in figure was abel inverted by the pbasex algorithm at each photoelectron energy of the grid the photoelectron angular distribution is given by truncated sum of even legendre polynomials np cos here is the angle with respect to the xuv polarization direction high harmonic efficiency measurement we now estimate the efficiency of conversion of hhg generated in argon from driving laser energy into xuv energy the energy content of each harmonic peak per unit of driving laser pulse energy derived from the vmi measurements of figure is reported in figure and the corresponding parameters can be found in figure assuming constant gas target density in the vmi interaction region and knowing the photoionization cross sections for argon and neon these measurements can be compared directly small corrections for the aluminum filter transmission were also made assuming chemical composition of nm of pure aluminum and nm of al harmonics up to order and could be observed at nm nm and nm respectively the xuv energy per pulse was integrated over the photon energy band ev there are six odd harmonics of nm three odd harmonics of nm but only and could be measured above noise level and two odd harmonics of nm the results of the integration are presented in figure we found that high harmonic conversion efficiency scales as with for the ev range taken as whole in terms of conversion efficiency per harmonic order averaged in the same range the exponent is this slope is smaller than the single atom response of reported by shiner et al the lower exponent that we observe is more consistent with where an exponent per harmonic order was measured at ev using driving wavelengths of nm this discrepancy can be explained by the fact that at nm there is no plateau in the harmonic spectrum and the three step model of hhg does not apply as our experimental conditions such as beam size intensity ionization of the medium and gas jet position are not as well maintained as shiner et al we do not claim to be measuring the single atom response we are rather measuring relative conversion efficiency for the practical case where thin gas jet is used to generate harmonics in figure we also show the predicted single atom wavelength scaling from tdse calculation for constant laser intensity the parameters were ionization potential of ev peak intensity of cm sup sup pulse duration fs energy integrated over ev the single atom single intensity scaling of conversion efficiency is with the discrepancy between the calculation and the experiment is due to not controlling the intensity and pulse duration in the experiment conclusions we have shown that there are clear advantages to using short wavelength lasers to create vacuum ultraviolet light radiation via hhg the addition of one or two nonlinear crystals is relatively easy to implement experimentally the advantageous scaling of the conversion efficiency integrated over all harmonic orders in the range ev or per harmonic order in the range ev more than makes up for the additional effort the high brightness and greater free spectral range of the resulting harmonic comb and its short duration make an ideal workhorse to perform time resolved
