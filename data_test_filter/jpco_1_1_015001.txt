optical bessel beam illumination of subwavelength prolate gold au spheroid coated by layer of plasmonic material radiation force spin and orbital torques the optical radiation force spin and orbital torques exerted on subwavelength prolate gold spheroid coated by layer of plasmonic material with negative permittivity and illuminated by either zeroth order non vortex or first order vector bessel vortex beam are computed in the framework of the electric dipole approximation method calculations for the cartesian components of the optical radiation force on subwavelength spheroid with arbitrary orientation in space are performed with emphasis on the order or topological charge half cone angle of the beam and the plasmonic layer thickness on and off resonance repulsive pushing force is predicted for the layered subwavelength prolate spheroid on and off resonance along the direction of wave propagation moreover the cartesian components of the spin radiation torque are computed where negative longitudinal spin torque component can arise suggesting rotational twist of the spheroid around its center of mass in either the counter clockwise or the clockwise negative direction of spinning in addition the longitudinal component of the orbital radiation torque exhibits sign reversal indicating revolution around the beam axis in either the counter clockwise or the clockwise directions the results show that the plasmonic resonance strongly alters the force spin and orbital torque components causing major amplitude enhancements signs twists and complex distributions in the transverse plane introduction elongated gold au spheroidal nanoparticles coated by metallic plasmonic layer such as silver copper or other artificial materials etc are particularly useful in various inorganic chemistry metamaterials drug delivery biosensing and biophysics applications to name few examples carefully designed conformal plasmonic layer coating of such particles provides the capability of detecting single molecule events by monitoring the shift of the plasmonic resonance in practice these particles can be rotated and transported before they get released to the desired site using optical tweezers and tractor beams due to the transfer of linear and angular momenta carried by light waves optimal design often relies on the computational modeling of the induced optical force spin and orbital torques as priori information used for experimental guidance thus numerical simulations constitute indispensable tools for guiding and improving the functionalities of the technological devices and experimental setups several investigations considered computational analyses for the optical force and torques on spheroidal particles in optical tweezers including the long wavelength rayleigh limit in gaussian and focused beams bessel beams and light sheets as well as the geometrical optics regime tailoring the incident wave field and beam profile to enhance or reduce light scattering from the particle can create paradigm shift in optical manipulation procedures such that negative pulling or positive pushing forces can be generated and used to advantage depending on the application in mind such beams include circularly polarized or helicoidal vortex beams possessing phase singularity high order bessel vector beam hobvb possesses an axial phase singularity null in amplitude or intensity at the central region such beam is characterized by an integer positive or negative topological charge or order and half cone angle such that below the paraxial approximation holds notice that the dimensions of the singularity in the axial region increase as increases moreover the hobvb resists diffraction over an extended distance of several wavelengths and has the capability to reform after encountering an obstruction as long as the whole beam is not blocked in addition hobvb has the capability of inducing negative pulling radiation force as well as spin and orbital torque reversal depending on the beam parameters all these properties make the optical hobvb an attractive candivarious investigations recognizing the importance and utility of the hobvb considered the case of sphere and examined the resonance scattering radiation forces and torques nonetheless in some instances the actual shapes of variety of objects deviate significantly from the spherical geometry thus applying the standard formulations devoted initially to spheres leads to significant miscalculations of the force spin and orbital torque components for elongated aggregates recognizing the need to fill this gap numerous investigations considered the spheroidal elongated particle geometry in plane waves and gaussian beams the aim of this work is therefore directed towards providing formalism to predict numerically the mechanical effects induced by an optical hobvb interacting with coated prolate subwavelength spheroid figure in the framework of the electric dipole approximation although recent works considered the optically active semiconducting and dielectric spheroidal particles the particular case of subwavelength spheroid coated by plasmonic layer of material with refractive index different from that of the surrounding medium is of particular interest in various biophysical bio sensing nanomaterials and other applications since new class of biosensors can emerge which consists of detecting molecular events at the early stage the plasmonic resonance effect can be harnessed from the standpoint of particle manipulation and handling applications in order to achieve high performance optical devices and systems therefore it is of some importance to examine the features of plasmonic coating combined with those of dielectric core material in single object such as the layered spheroid from the standpoint of the optical radiation force spin and orbital torque theories section provides description of the method in the framework of the electric dipole approximation method and from the standpoint of the radiation force spin and orbital torque theories where the modified electric polarizability for the coated spheroid is defined as tensor of rank two and includes the radiative correction of the electric field section is devoted to numerical examples for layered spheroid in hobvb with particular emphasis on the beam parameters and the plasmonic layer thickness the electric field components for the hobvb are determined based on the dual field method stemming from the lorenz gauge condition and maxwell equations adequate discussions of the results are also provided while section concludes this work method dielectric subwavelength coated spheroid subjected to an incident optical beam develops an electric dipole moment such that the resulting electric radiation force in medium of wave propagation that is nonmagnetic and nonelectric with unit index of refraction such as vacuum is expressed as where is the real part of complex number the symbol denotes tensor product represents the electric dipole moment is the modified electric polarizability which accounts for the radiative nature of the field the double over bar denotes tensor of rank two is the incident electric field and the superscript denotes the conjugate of complex number the modified electric polarizability tensor is generally complex number given as where the matrix representing for coated spheroid is expressed as the coefficients and are the components of the static electric molecular polarizability tensor which are expressed as where and are the permittivities of the coating and the bare spheroid respectively notice that for optically absorptive or active coating and or core materials and are generally complex numbers the parameter aebe is the volume of the coated spheroid aibi aebe is the fraction of particle volume occupied by the internal spheroid the parameters and are the internal and external semi major and semi minor axes of the coated spheroid respectively figure and the depolarizing factors are given as where the interior and exterior semi axes satisfy the confocal condition ae be ai bi which leads to layer of non uniform thickness across the surface of the prolate spheroid the rotation of the spheroid with respect to its center of mass is described by two additional angular parameters where and are the polar and azimuthal angles of the major axis respectively figure the rotation of the spheroid in space affects the modified and static polarizability tensors and respectively such that in matrix notation ij ri and ij ri where the rotation matrix is given by in addition to the radiation force the layered spheroid experiences spin radiation torque vector ts causing its spinning around its center mass as well as longitudinal orbital torque component tzo to ez known also as the torque of revolution causing its rotation around the main axis of the incident beam in the plane perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation where ez is the unit vector along the direction of wave propagation unlike the case of coated sphere for which energy absorption in its coating core materials is required in order that it experiences spin torque causing its rotation around its center of mass the layered spheroid considered here which is made of lossless coating core materials is subjected to non zero spin torque depending on its orientation in space furthermore the orbital torque only has longitudinal component tzo as the orbiting of the spheroid around the beam axis occurs solely in the transversal plane the total radiation torque is expressed as where the spin torque is expressed as the longitudinal orbital torque component along the direction of wave propagation is calculated from the transverse components of the force given by equation such that where is the vector position equations and show that the radiation force and torque expressions depend directly on the incident electric of the hobvb for an unpolarized hobvb with harmonic time dependence in the form of exp omitted from the equations for convenience the expressions for the cartesian components of the electric field are given by where ika is an amplitude factor tan is the azimuthal angle kz kcos ksin is the radial distance to point in the transverse plane is the half cone angle of the beam and jm is the cylindrical bessel function of the first kind of order which determines also the topological charge or order of the hobvb numerical results and discussions the analysis is started by developing matlab numerical code to implement equations and compute the optical radiation force spin and orbital torque components for gold au spheroid in air with permittivity coefficient coated by plasmonic layer of material with permittivity coefficient the cartesian components of the optical radiation force and radiation spin and orbital torques are computed in the ranges kx ky initially rayleigh prolate spheroid is considered with ka kb to characterize the properties of the layered spheroid computational plots for the components of the modified electric polarizability given by equation are evaluated by varying the relative thickness of the layer as well as its permittivity the chosen bandwidths are and panels of figure illustrate the results for this example where the real part of the transverse and longitudinal modified polarizability components panels and display positive and negative values while the imaginary part shown in panels and only show positive values those plots show that each of the modified polarizability component for the subwavelength spheroid coated by layer of plasmonic material exhibits particular resonance determined by the values of the layer thickness and its permittivity it is anticipated that these effects significantly modify the radiation force spin and orbital torques as will be further examined in the following the first example considers the case of gold prolate spheroid with ka kb and coated by layer of plasmonic material such that and the layer material properties are selected based upon the plots of figure denoted by mark in figure such that no resonance occurs for this set of parameters the subwavelength spheroid in air is illuminated by an optical zeroth order bessel beam with and its orientation angles in space are chosen to illustrate the analysis panel of figure displays the results for the radiation force components where the background corresponds to the longitudinal component of the force vector while the vector arrows superimposed on the plot denote the transverse radiation force vector field as observed from the background plot the longitudinal force component is always positive which tends to push the coated prolate spheroid away from the source along the direction of wave propagation moreover the transverse vector force field represented by the vector arrows converges towards the main axis and has the tendency of pushing the prolate spheroid to the central region panel of figure shows the plots for the spin radiation torque components where the background is for the longitudinal component tzs while the vector arrows superimposed on the plot denote the transverse spin radiation torque vector field txs tys the background plot for the longitudinal spin torque component shows that tzs is negative over well defined regions around the main axis and as the radial distance increases the transverse vector field denoted by the arrows points towards the positive ky direction suggesting transverse spin torque component tys larger than txs panel of figure displays the longitudinal orbital torque component over which the transverse radiation force vector field is superimposed also tzo displays negative values suggesting sense of rotation in the counter clockwise direction not in phase with those of the spin radiation torque component tzs as shown in panel moreover the longitudinal spin radiation torque component is an order of magnitude smaller than its orbital counterpart guided by the plots of figure layer of plasmonic material is chosen such that and denoted by mark in figure this choice of parameters indicates the emergence of plasmonic resonance in the plots of keeping all the other parameters of the prolate spheroid and incident beam the same numerical simulations for the force and torque components are performed and the results are displayed in figure panel of figure displays the longitudinal force component at resonance which is about five orders of magnitudes larger than its counterpart away from the plasmonic resonance panel of figure moreover the transverse vector force field denoted by the arrows converges no longer to the main central region as observed in panel of figure rather it has tendency to push the prolate spheroid along the negative kx direction in addition quasi vortex behavior of the transverse vector field is manifested from either side of the main axis kx ky such that for ky clockwise sense of rotation is observed whereas for ky counter clockwise sense of rotation is exhibited the plots for the longitudinal spin and orbital torque components displayed in panels and of figure also show an amplitude increase of about two orders of magnitudes compared to those of figure and negative longitudinal spin and orbital torques can still occur at the plasmonic resonance moreover panel shows that the transverse spin torque vector field is oriented towards the positive ky direction for kx while the sign of the vector arrows is reversed for kx the effect of increasing the order of the beam to is further investigated for the prolate spheroid having ka kb and and coated by layer of plasmonic material such that and the half cone angle of the first order bessel vortex beam is and the orientation angles of the spheroid in space are panel of figure shows an asymmetric behavior of the longitudinal force component in the form of crescent in the transverse plane kx ky where the transverse vector force field converges for the maximal value of nevertheless it diverges radially below the crescent suggesting that the prolate spheroid may be pushed outside that zone this behavior is different from panel of figure for the zeroth order bessel beam moreover suggests the emergence of pushing repulsive longitudinal force acting in the forward direction of wave propagation the background plot in panel shows the longitudinal spin radiation torque component which displays negative and positive values suggesting counter clockwise or clockwise sense of rotation around the center of mass of the layered spheroid respectively an asymmetry in the plot of tzs also arises versus the central axis kx moreover the transverse vector force field denoted by the arrows is directed towards the positive ky direction suggesting that tys txs as observed previously in panel of figure for the zeroth order bessel beam panel displays the plot for the longitudinal radiation torque component which is also asymmetric with respect to the axis kx tzo exhibits negative and positive values suggesting counter clockwise and clockwise sense of revolution around the beam axis centered at kx ky respectively comparison between panels and of figure shows that the longitudinal spin and orbital torque components are not in phase in the region where tzs is positive tzo is negative and vice versa additional computations are performed for the first order bessel vortex beam with illuminating the layered prolate spheroid at the plasmonic resonance similarly to the case treated for figure for which ka kb and panel of figure shows about five orders of magnitudes increase in the longitudinal force amplitude while the transverse vector force field exhibits quasi vortex like structure in the counter clockwise direction compared with panel of figure it can be concluded that the plasmonic resonance affects the behavior of the force vector components panel displays the spin radiation torque components where tzs can alternate between positive and negative values while the transverse spin torque vector field behaves similarly to its counterpart for the zeroth order bessel beam at the plasmonic resonance panel of figure interestingly panel of figure for the longitudinal orbital torque component tzo shows behavior comparable to that of of panel with the emergence of crescent region of large amplitude nonetheless it reverses sign depending on the shift from the center of the beam where it vanishes therein in the transverse plane the transverse radiation force vector field is superimposed and denoted by the arrows that display the same quasi vortex like structure in the counter clockwise direction shown in panel the effect of increasing the half cone angle to is further investigated and the corresponding radiation force and torque results for the layered spheroid for which ka kb and in first order bessel vortex beam are shown in the panels of figure the one to one comparison of each of the panels with those of figure shows that the longitudinal force spin and orbital torque components are reduced and the amplitude maxima are narrower for panels and complex patterns arise as the half cone angle of the beam increases finally the variations of the radiation force spin and orbital torque components versus the orientation angles have been computed in the ranges and the same layered prolate spheroid parameters considered previously for figure are used such that ka kb and considering zeroth order bessel beam with the shift from the center of the beam is kx ky chosen as an example to illustrate the analysis the corresponding results are displayed in panels of figure for the cartesian components of the force and torques as the shift from the center of the beam is non zero the transverse components of the optical force shown in panels and do not vanish nonetheless along some specific polar and azimuthal orientation directions the transverse components vanish due to symmetry consideration notice also that the longitudinal force component shown in panel is positive regardless of the values of the orientation angles thus the repulsive beam effect on the layered prolate subwavelength spheroid is manifested regardless of the orientation angles similar variations have been also observed for the spin torque components shown in panels of figure the longitudinal spin torque component vanishes along symmetry orientation directional lines for or as required by symmetry similarly the longitudinal orbital torque component shown in panel vanishes for or the effect of increasing the order of the beam to and keeping all the other parameters the same is also examined and the corresponding results are displayed in the panels of figure the one to one comparison of each of the panels with those of figure shows that the force spin and orbital torque components are significantly altered as more complex variations arise as increases one aspect in which the calculations for the optical radiation force spin and orbital torque components obtained here can be beneficial is the prediction of the translational and rotational dynamics of the subwavelength layered spheroid in hobvb depending on the incident beam parameters and field intensity as well as the physical properties of the spheroid brownian motion viscous drag optical streaming nearby boundary wall buoyancy and other elements can influence the translational and rotational dynamics typically pre calculated force spin and orbital torque vector components at any position in space are used in applying newton second law of motion to compute the trajectories examples can be found for an infinite cylinder of circular cross section in hermite gaussian light sheets sphere in airy or coated sphere in bessel pincers light sheets large ellipsoids in collimated and focused beams and multiple spheroidal particles in circularly polarized dual beam trap to mention few the scope of the present analysis can be further extended to include particle dynamics computations and this work should assist along that direction of research it should be also noted here that the generation of negative optical spin and orbital torques is in complete agreement with energy conservation since computations not shown here for the rates of energy extinction and scattering by the lossless spheroid coated by non absorptive plasmonic layer of material have shown equal results notice that the rate of energy absorption by the subwavelength spheroid considered here is zero it must be recalled here that the spin torque reversal has been observed initially in the context of scalar acoustical hobvb incident upon viscous sphere located arbitrarily in space figure in as well as vector optical hobvbs on dielectric absorptive and semiconducting spheres satisfying energy conservation furthermore the orbital torque sign reversal initially observed in the context of circularly polarized gaussian laser beam incident upon an absorptive sphere figure in and predicted previously for vector hobvbs on semiconducting lossy sphere is anticipated here on subwavelength layered lossless spheroid as shown by the results of the present study notice on the other hand that for scalar acoustical hobvb incident on subwavelength rayleigh viscous fluid sphere the orbital torque sign reversal does not occur conclusion within the framework of the dielectric dipole approximation method analytical solutions for the optical radiation force spin and orbital torques are used to compute the mechanical effects of optical bessel beams of zeroth and first orders on non absorptive prolate subwavelength spheroid coated by plasmonic layer of lossless material in contrast to the cases dealing with bessel beam illumination of an optically active or semiconducting subwavelength spheroid where negative pulling longitudinal forces arise displaying tractor beam effect the lossless dielectric subwavelength spheroid coated by plasmonic layer of non absorptive material considered here always experiences pushing longitudinal force component directed in the forward direction of wave propagation and the transverse forces induce collimating effect toward the central axis of the beam off the plasmonic resonance nevertheless this effect does not occur at the plasmonic resonance where large amplitude enhancements of the positive longitudinal force component occur moreover the layered spheroid is shown to experience negative spin and orbital torques causing rotation around its center of mass and revolution around the beam axis respectively in either the counter clockwise or the clockwise directions unlike the case of sphere the subwavelength spheroid experiences rotation around its center of mass in the ideal case of no absorption inside its coating core materials when located arbitrarily in the field of optical bessel beams depending on the polar and azimuthal orientation angles the results of this analysis find potential applications in optical tweezers tractor beams and other related topics in particle manipulation and handling
